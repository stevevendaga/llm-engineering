How to use both Anaconda and VS Code for LLM project
 Open Ananconda Powershell Prompt or Anaconda Prompt
 Navigate to the project directory (Cd ...)
	Create environment
conda create --name llm-engineer python=3.12
conda activate llm-engineer

	Install packages
Use environment.yml (Recommended for Conda + Pip combo)
Create a file named environment.yml in your project folder
pip included under dependencies so that pip install works inside the conda environment.

name: llm-engineer #name of conda environment
channels:
  - defaults
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  # Conda packages
  - python=3.12
  - jupyter
  - numpy
  - pandas

  # Other conda packages (optional)
  - pip

  # Pip-installed packages (inside conda env)
  - pip:
    - torch
    - transformers
    - accelerate
    - langchain
    - openai
    - tiktoken
    - datasets

	Install All Packages at Once
Run this in your terminal:
conda env create -f environment.yml

For new added packages
# Update the environment with the new packages
conda env update -f environment.yml


This creates an environment called llm-engineer with all packages installed.
First time? You might see: EnvironmentNameExistsError — delete old one first:
conda env remove -n llm-engineer

Update Environment Later?
conda env update -f environment.yml –prune
(--prune removes packages no longer in the file)

	Register kernel for VS Code
python -m ipykernel install --user --name llm-engineer --display-name "LLM Engineer"

	Start coding in VS Code
code .

	Install Python and Jupyter extensions in VS Code

	Create a .ipynb file, open the file. Locate Select Kernel and then select LLM Engineer
