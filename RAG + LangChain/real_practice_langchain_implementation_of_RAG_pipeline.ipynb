Highlight who is affected, where, and why is it important to focus on the identified group or sub-population?*\\n\\n*Sub-Saharan Africa is grappling with a significant HIV/AIDS burden, particularly among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW). Despite comprising only 10% of the total population, AGYW account for about 25% of all HIV infections. UNAIDS reported that 6,200 young women aged 15-24 are infected with HIV on a weekly basis worldwide, highlighting the urgent need for targeted interventions. Various factors contribute to the heightened vulnerability of AGYW to HIV, including socio-cultural barriers to comprehensive sexuality education, inter-generational and transactional sex practices, lack of schooling and economic empowerment, gender-based violence, and harmful traditional practices.*\\n\\n* *What is the proposed solution? Has it been used before? If so, how (and where) was it used and how effective was it? (Useful to provide evidence for this - references). Why do you think the proposed intervention would be effective for the problem described above?*\\n\\nIn response to these challenges, the Center for Integrated Health Programs (CIHP) has developed the Cool Girls Program, an innovative approach aimed at HIV prevention and treatment among AGYW aged 15-24. Leveraging technology, specifically social media applications, the program facilitates access to vital information and support. The curriculum covers essential topics such as abstinence, safe sex negotiation skills, dating, gender-based violence awareness, assertiveness, and self-esteem building. Subject matter experts from CIHP engage AGYW through facilitated discussions on the mobile platform, providing them with knowledge and tools to make informed decisions regarding HIV prevention and treatment. Because the Cool Girls Program offers several elements that suggest its potential effectivenessOverall, the combination of technology, comprehensive curriculum, expert facilitation, interactive discussions, and empowerment strategies suggests that the Cool Girls Program has the potential to effectively address the challenges of HIV prevention and treatment among AGYW aged 15-24 in Sub-Saharan Africa.\\n\\nObjectives and outcomes of the intervention\\n\\n* *Describe what would be achieved by the intervention, outlining clear and SMART objectives (maybe one or more)*\\n\\n* Provide targeted messaging on sexual and reproductive health, HIV prevention, treatment adherence, mental well-being, and one-on-one mentoring, along with referrals to services using the cool girls mobile app.\\n\\n* The Cool Girls Program targets reducing HIV infection rates and preventing transmission among AGYW.\\n\\n*Specify the****expected****outcomes related to each of the objectives and highlight the primary outcome if more than one outcome*\\n\\n* *Through bridging knowledge gaps and fostering behavioral change, the program aims to achieve these goals over time.*\\n* *Decreased HIV Infection Rates: By targeting HIV prevention measures and offering treatment support to AGYW who are already HIV-positive, the Cool*\\n* *Girls Program aims to contribute to a reduction in HIV infection rates among this demographic over time. By bridging knowledge gaps and fostering behavioral change, the program works towards this outcome.*\\n\\n*Improved Well-being and Empowerment: AGYW participating in the Cool Girls Program will benefit from targeted messaging on sexual and reproductive health, HIV prevention, and mental well-being, as well as one-on-one mentoring and service referrals. As a result, participants can experience improved well-being and empowerment, gaining the knowledge and support needed to make informed decisions about their health and future. Additionally, the program provides a safe and supportive environment for learning, networking, and enjoyment, further contributing to the overall well-being of AGYW.*\\n\\nPrimary outcome Indicators\\n\\n* 1. Proportion of AGYW with improved knowledge and skills on SRH, HIV, GBV and Mental Health\\n  2. Proportion of AGYW who reported sexual assault or harassment/spoke out for someone else\\n  3. Proportion of AGYW with high HIV risk perception\\n  4. Proportion of AGYW who reported abstinence from sex for at least 6 months\\n  5. Proportion of AGYW (sexually naïve) who reported delayed sexual debut\\n  6. Proportion of AGYW (sexually active) who reported consistent use of condom with sexual partners\\n  7. Proportion of AGYW (sexually active) who reported faithfulness to one sexual partner\\n  8. Proportion of AGYW who completed referral for SRH, HIV, GBV and Mental Health services\\n  9. Proportion of AGYW who received post-GBV services\\n  10. Proportion of AGYW who received mental health services\\n  11. Number of AGYW who tested HIV positive\\n\\nSecondary Outcomes\\n\\n1. Proportion of AGYW who tested HIV positive and were linked to care and treatment services\\n2. Proportion of AGYW who are virally suppressed\\n\\n4.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0**Methods**\\n\\nDescription of the intervention\\n\\n*Describe the set of related activities or strategies that constitute the proposed solution to the problem identified above***.***This should provide clear details to guide anyone wishing to replicate them. Specify the timeline for intervention.*\\n\\n* **Leveraging Technology**: By utilizing social media applications, the program taps into a platform that is widely accessed by AGYW. This ensures easy and convenient access to information and support, meeting the target demographic where they already spend a significant amount of their time.\\n* **Comprehensive Curriculum**: The curriculum covers a wide range of essential topics relevant to HIV prevention and treatment, including abstinence, safe sex negotiation skills, dating, gender-based violence awareness, assertiveness, and self-esteem building. This holistic approach addresses various aspects of AGYW's lives, empowering them with the necessary knowledge and skills to make informed decisions.\\n* **Expert Facilitation**: Engagement with subject matter experts from CIHP ensures the delivery of accurate and relevant information. Their expertise adds credibility to the program and fosters trust among participants, enhancing the effectiveness of the intervention.\\n* **Interactive Discussions**: Facilitated discussions on the mobile platform provide AGYW with a supportive environment to ask questions, share experiences, and seek guidance. This interactive format promotes engagement and active participation, facilitating learning and behavior change.\\n* **Empowerment**: By equipping AGYW with knowledge and tools, the program aims to empower them to take control of their sexual and reproductive health. This empowerment can lead to increased confidence, assertiveness, and agency in making decisions related to HIV prevention and treatment.\\n\\nLocation\\n\\n*Give a brief*\\xa0*on the settings where you will implement this intervention – e.g. which state, community/facility or both?*\\n\\n*The intervention will leverage the CIHP innovative social media platform, the cool girls mobile app, making the app accessible to eligible girls from various locations. However, we will hold occasional physical hangouts in our implementing state (Kogi, Kaduna and Lagos states).*\\n\\n*Any local factors that will make this intervention appropriate for the selected location/setting?*\\n\\n*A survey was conducted among adolescent girls to choose their preferred means of interaction, most of the girls preferred social media which has a wide coverage, is cost efficient and contents are documented for reference.*\\n\\n\\xa0Study population\\n\\n·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0*Describe the population/sub-population the intervention will target*.\\n\\n*The intervention, the Cool Girls Program, is designed to target adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) aged 15-24 years old. This population/sub-population includes individuals who are particularly vulnerable to HIV infection due to socio-cultural factors, lack of comprehensive sexuality education, gender-based violence, and other challenges prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa. AGYW are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS, accounting for a significant portion of new infections globally. Therefore, the program focuses on empowering this demographic with knowledge and skills for HIV prevention and treatment, as well as providing support for those who are already living with HIV.*\\n\\nData collection\\n\\n·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0*Will the data be quantitative or qualitative?*\\n\\n*Both quantitative and qualitative*\\n\\n*What is the plan for baseline and subsequent data collection, if applicable?
