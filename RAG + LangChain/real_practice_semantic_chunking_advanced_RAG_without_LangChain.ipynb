The curriculum covers essential topics such as abstinence, safe sex negotiation skills, dating, gender-based violence awareness, assertiveness, and self-esteem building.

This population/sub-population includes individuals who are particularly vulnerable to HIV infection due to socio-cultural factors, lack of comprehensive sexuality education, gender-based violence, and other challenges prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa. AGYW are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS, accounting for a significant portion of new infections globally. Therefore, the program focuses on empowering this demographic with knowledge and skills for HIV prevention and treatment, as well as providing support for those who are already living with HIV.*\\n\\nData collection\\n\\n·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0*Will the data be quantitative or qualitative?*\\n\\n*Both quantitative and qualitative*\\n\\n*What is the plan for baseline and subsequent data collection, if applicable?

Highlight who is affected, where, and why is it important to focus on the identified group or sub-population?*\\n\\n*Sub-Saharan Africa is grappling with a significant HIV/AIDS burden, particularly among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW). Despite comprising only 10% of the total population, AGYW account for about 25% of all HIV infections. UNAIDS reported that 6,200 young women aged 15-24 are infected with HIV on a weekly basis worldwide, highlighting the urgent need for targeted interventions. Various factors contribute to the heightened vulnerability of AGYW to HIV, including socio-cultural barriers to comprehensive sexuality education, inter-generational and transactional sex practices, lack of schooling and economic empowerment, gender-based violence, and harmful traditional practices.*\\n\\n* *What is the proposed solution? Has it been used before? If so, how (and where) was it used and how effective was it? (Useful to provide evidence for this - references). Why do you think the proposed intervention would be effective for the problem described above?*\\n\\nIn response to these challenges, the Center for Integrated Health Programs (CIHP) has developed the Cool Girls Program, an innovative approach aimed at HIV prevention and treatment among AGYW aged 15-24. Leveraging technology, specifically social media applications, the program facilitates access to vital information and support. The curriculum covers essential topics such as abstinence, safe sex negotiation skills, dating, gender-based violence awareness, assertiveness, and self-esteem building. Subject matter experts from CIHP engage AGYW through facilitated discussions on the mobile platform, providing them with knowledge and tools to make informed decisions regarding HIV prevention and treatment. Because the Cool Girls Program offers several elements that suggest its potential effectivenessOverall, the combination of technology, comprehensive curriculum, expert facilitation, interactive discussions, and empowerment strategies suggests that the Cool Girls Program has the potential to effectively address the challenges of HIV prevention and treatment among AGYW aged 15-24 in Sub-Saharan Africa.\", metadata={'source': 'knowledge-base-cihp/coolgirls/Cool girls concept note for evaluation .docx.md', 'type': 'coolgirls'})]"
