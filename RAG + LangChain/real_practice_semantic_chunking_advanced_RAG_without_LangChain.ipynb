The curriculum covers essential topics such as abstinence, safe sex negotiation skills, dating, gender-based violence awareness, assertiveness, and self-esteem building.

AGYW are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS, accounting for a significant portion of new infections globally.

Despite comprising only 10% of the total population, AGYW account for about 25% of all HIV infections. UNAIDS reported that 6,200 young women aged 15-24 are infected with HIV on a weekly basis worldwide, highlighting the urgent need for targeted interventions. Various factors contribute to the heightened vulnerability of AGYW to HIV, including socio-cultural barriers to comprehensive sexuality education, inter-generational and transactional sex practices, lack of schooling and economic empowerment, gender-based violence, and harmful traditional practices.*', metadata={'source': 'knowledge-base-cihp/coolgirls/Cool girls concept note for evaluation .docx.md', 'type': 'coolgirls'}),\n",

Has it been used before? If so, how (and where) was it used and how effective was it? (Useful to provide evidence for this - references). Why do you think the proposed intervention would be effective for the problem described above?*\\n\\nIn response to these challenges, the Center for Integrated Health Programs (CIHP) has developed the Cool Girls Program, an innovative approach aimed at HIV prevention and treatment among AGYW aged 15-24. Leveraging technology, specifically social media applications, the program facilitates access to vital information and support. The curriculum covers essential topics such as abstinence, safe sex negotiation skills, dating, gender-based violence awareness, assertiveness, and self-esteem building. Subject matter experts from CIHP engage AGYW through facilitated discussions on the mobile platform, providing them with knowledge and tools to make informed decisions regarding HIV prevention and treatment. Because the Cool Girls Program offers several elements that suggest its potential effectivenessOverall, the combination of technology, comprehensive curriculum, expert facilitation, interactive discussions, and empowerment strategies suggests that the Cool Girls Program has the potential to effectively address the challenges of HIV prevention and treatment among AGYW aged 15-24 in Sub-Saharan Africa.', metadata={'source': 'knowledge-base-cihp/coolgirls/Cool girls concept note for evaluation .docx.md', 'type': 'coolgirls'}),\n",

Despite comprising only 10% of the total population, AGYW account for about 25% of all HIV infections. UNAIDS reported that 6,200 young women aged 15-24 are infected with HIV on a weekly basis worldwide, highlighting the urgent need for targeted interventions. Various factors contribute to the heightened vulnerability of AGYW to HIV, including socio-cultural barriers to comprehensive sexuality education, inter-generational and transactional sex practices, lack of schooling and economic empowerment, gender-based violence, and harmful traditional practices.*\\n\\n* *What is the proposed solution? Has it been used before? If so, how (and where) was it used and how effective was it? (Useful to provide evidence for this - references). Why do you think the proposed intervention would be effective for the problem described above?*\\n\\nIn response to these challenges, the Center for Integrated Health Programs (CIHP) has developed the Cool Girls Program, an innovative approach aimed at HIV prevention and treatment among AGYW aged 15-24. Leveraging technology, specifically social media applications, the program facilitates access to vital information and support. The curriculum covers essential topics such as abstinence, safe sex negotiation skills, dating, gender-based violence awareness, assertiveness, and self-esteem building.

Information technology plays an integral part in the fulfillment of CIHP’s, management, programmatic, administrative, and other roles.

Using electronic mail ('email') instead of standard written correspondence, for example, does not fundamentally alter the nature of the communication, nor does it alter the guiding policies.

All account requests require the approval of the IT Manager and Director, Management Support Services.\\n\\n1.6 Safety & Security of IT Equipment\\nUsers are responsible for the security and safety of the equipment that they are assigned by the IT Manager, as outlined in these standard operating procedures. Important measures must be taken by each user and each office to provide optimal security for CIHP’s IT systems.\\n\\n1.7 Back-ups\\nNo matter how careful the users, computers will eventually fail. Having recent back-ups of important documents can avoid inefficiencies and delays in CIHP operations. Network drives (G & O) are directly located on central file server and are backed up on daily-incremental, weekly-full and monthly-full backup plans by the network administrator. These backup files are kept in the fireproof safe located in the IT office.\\nAn annual full backup is conducted once a year and kept offsite with a copy made for the CEO. Users are to ensure that only official documents are stored in these drives.\\nStates offices are provided with external hard-drives to serve as backup device for sensitive official information. The operation and safe keeping of the drives is handled by Finance & Admin staff in each of the State offices. These drives are sent to the central office in Abuja when they have almost reached their full capacity (80% and above). The network administrator subsequently carries out the transfer of the data unto the fileserver and conducts a backup operation as appropriate.\\nAll computers in the state and site offices are backed-up during scheduled visits by the central IT team. These backups are archived in the respective state and site folders on servers at the central office.\\n\\n1.8 Maintenance\\nThere shall be quarterly maintenance for all IT equipments both in the central office and the State offices. This shall be coordinated by the IT Manager. A maintenance schedule shall be prepared on a quarterly basis to capture systems preventive maintenance with dates, location and users.\\n\\n1.9 General Security\\nPasswords: Users are responsible for securing the passwords to their various CIHP- assigned accounts. Users must not share their passwords with third parties.\\nComputer Protection: Users are responsible for maintaining the overall functionality of their computers. IT unit will facilitate the installation of periodic security updates as distributed by the respective operating system vendor.
