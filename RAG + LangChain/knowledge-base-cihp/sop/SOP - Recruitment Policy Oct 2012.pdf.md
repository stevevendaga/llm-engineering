In order to achieve its mission, CIHP seeks to recruit staff of the highest standard of competence
that are capable of implementing the activities related to the advertised job requirements.  CIHP
is  an  equal  opportunity  employer-it  does  not  discriminate  against  applicants  or  would-be
employees  on  the  basis  of  race,  color,  sex,  gender,  religion,  creed,  national  and  ethnic  origin,

Selection process for Permanent full time employees

Step 1: Develop the job description

The Unit Head will identify the need for staff for a specific job position and develop
the job description for the position. The job description is expected to include the following
Information

1.  Title of the position
2.  Location
3.  Position Supervisor
4.  The context of the position within the organization/department
5.  Minimum qualification required to perform the job

The completed job description will be developed with inputs from the HR unit and submitted by
the supervisor to the Chief Executive Officer for approval through appropriate channels. Where
the position requires concurrence from the donor, this concurrence must also be sought as soon
as the job description is developed.

Step 2: Completion of the Job Requisition Form

The Senior Human Resources Manager (SHRM) is responsible for completing a Job Requisition
Form for each position after the job description or ToR has been completed as required by the
SOP Section 5.1.1. Both the job description and the Job Requisition Form require the sign off of
the Chief Executive Officer prior to the advertisement of a vacant position.

Step 3: Advertisement

Using the approved job description, the senior HR Manager puts together a vacancy advert to be
placed in the Newspapers. Adverts are open to both internal and external candidates. Responses
to  adverts  are  usually  open  for  two  weeks.  Responses  are  received  electronically  via  an
anonymous  email  account  specifically  created  by  CIHP  for  that  purpose.  Prior  to  advert
placement in the newspapers, the vacancy adverts may be reviewed by advertising agents who
prepare the art work and add some professionalism into the advert and prepare the artwork. The
final draft of the vacancy advert must be signed off by the Chief Executive Officer before they
are published.

Depending on the position and special circumstances, other recruitment methods may be utilized,
such  as  headhunting,  public  announcements,  professional  personnel  recruitment  agents,  and
existing databases of previous applicants.

Step 4: Screening and Short listing of candidates
Screening and shortlisting of candidates for advertised positions may  be done in either of two
ways as follows:

1.

a.  Using  a  consultant:  In  instances  such  as  when  the  number  of  applications
received  for  an  advertised  position  may  be  determined  as  requiring  such
commitment of time and limited human resource capacity to achieve a timely
turn  around  time  of  six  weeks  from  the  end  date  for  submission  of
applications CIHP may engage a consultant who does the initial screening of
applications  received  against  the  advertised  criteria  for  the  position.  The
consultant  is  given  the  username  and  password  for  the  anonymous  email
account  that  the  applications  are  submitted  to,  and  works  remotely.  HR
specifies  the  number  of  applications  the  consultant  should  forward.  H/She
carries out the screening and submits the CVs of shortlisted candidates in an
electronic  folder  following  which  the  designated  CIHP  personnel  may
complete the final shortlist.

b.  An in house team made up of a minimum of three staff is constituted by the
Deputy Director of Management Support Services & New Business to review
all the applications received in respect of an advertised position. The Senior
Human Resource Manager is by default the secretary of each shortlist team.
Other  members  of  the  shortlist  team  would  include  the  position  supervisor
and  any  other  staff  nominated  by  the  relevant  Unit  Director.  Where  the
position is to be based in a state office or field location, the Unit Director in
consultation  with  the  Deputy  Director  of  Management  Support  Services  &
New  Business  will  nominate  the  appropriate  staff  to  conduct  the  shortlist
exercise.

The shortlist of suitable candidates for interview will based on already agreed criteria as
indicated in the position job description

2.  The shortlist team will write a memo detailing the shortlisted candidates along with their
CVs which will be forwarded to the relevant Unit Director depending on the position to
be  filled.  The  Unit  Director  or  designate  will  vet  the  list  of  shortlisted  candidates  and
their resumes for relevance to the position requirement.

3.  Final shortlist of candidates to be interviewed is forwarded to the Chief Executive Officer

for review and approval.

Step 5: Interviewing
After  the  final  approval  of  the  list  of  candidates  to  be  invited  for  interview  by  the  Chief
Executive  Officer  based  on  the  recommendations  of  the  shortlist  team,  an  interview  date  is
scheduled.  Ideally,  CIHP  will  inform  candidates  invited  for  an  interview  at  least  three  days  in
advance  of  the  interview  date  to  allow  such  candidates  to  clear  their  schedules  and  attend  the

interviews.  Invitations to attend interviews are sent out to candidates by email and confirmed by
phone calls.
Candidates  will  be  requested  to  come  for  the  interview  with  originals  and  copies  of  their
credentials  on  the  interview  day.  All  interview  candidates  fill  out  Contract  Employee
Biographical data sheet (biodata form) on arrival. Round trip transportation expenses incurred by
out of state candidates are reimbursed based on actual costs.

The Interview panel is constituted prior to the interview by holding discussions with the relevant
members  of  the  Leadership  group.  The  panel  is  comprised  of  a  minimum  of  three  members
including a representative from the HR Unit.
CIHP also applies a two stage interview process for technical positions. Stage 1 is the written test
usually  done  on  the  computer  to  ascertain  the  candidates’  basic  technical  knowledge  and
computer skills.
The second stage is the oral panel interview. Questions for this interview are usually preset and
are  a  mix  of  technical  questions  relevant  to  the  position  to  be  filled  and  general  questions  to
ascertain personality and some behavioral interviewing technique questions.

Where the requisite in-house technical expertise is not available to participate at the interview,
CIHP  may  invite  an  external  specialist  to  participate  in  the  interviews.  A  representative  of  the
donor agency may also be invited to participate at hiring interviews for very senior positions.

The interviews are documented using the Interview Assessment Form (see attached). At the end
of the interviews the panel members discuss their observations and arrive at a consensus /make
recommendations on a preferred candidate.

The complete interview documents are handed to the Senior Human Resources Manager after the
interviews; who writes them up and presents to each panel member for signature. The respective
State  Program  Managers  will  be  expected  to  conduct  a  telephone  interview  for  any  preferred
candidate identified for a position to be based at a state office. Their assessment of the candidate
will also be documented as part of the interview process.   The complete interview documents
are  forwarded  to  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  with  a  memo  requesting  for  approval  to  proceed
with hiring the recommended candidate.  Simultaneously, the Senior Human Resources Manager
also  solicits  relevant  references  on  the  approved  candidate  prior  to  hiring  decision.  The  final
decision whether to hire a candidate who has been recommended by an interview panel is at the
discretion of the Chief Executive Officer.

The Human Resources unit is responsible for all communications  with candidates applying for
positions  in  CIHP  including  communicating  the  outcome  of  the  interview  to  all  unsuccessful
candidates who proceed as far as the interview stage of the recruitment process.

Step 6: Reference checking

The  Senior  Human  Resources  Manager  checks  the  CVs  of  the  approved  candidates  for  their
references. Where they have not been listed on the CV or where the contact information provided

on  the  CV  is  insufficient,  the  SHRM  contacts  the  candidates  to  provide  information  on  their
referees. Three referees are required and at least two of them should be professional referees.
The referees are contacted and the standard reference forms are sent to them electronically (see
attached). Where the referee does not have an email address then a hard copy form could be sent.
Also  where  the  referee  is  delaying  to  respond,  he/she  may  be  contacted  and  interviewed  by
telephone  and  the  transcripts  of  the  conversation  recorded  on  the  standard  reference  forms
highlighting the date the call was made.

Step 7: Employment Offer and Acceptance.

Once  at  least  2  positive  references  are  on  file,  the  Senior  Human  Resources  Manager  makes  a
recommendation  on  the  appropriate  salary  for  the  position/candidate  with  guidance  from  the
approved  budget.  S/he  may  request  for  additional  documentation  to  support  the  salary  history
quoted in the candidates’ biodata for. S/he prepares the salary schedule (template attached) and
the Hire letter (sample attached). The salary schedule is signed by the Senior Human Resource
Manager, the Deputy Director of Management Support Services & New Business and the Chief
Executive Officer.

All employment letters are signed by the Chief Executive Officer.

Once  the  employment  offer  letter  has  been  signed  by  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  the  Senior
Human  Resources  Manager  sends  a  copy  to  the  candidate,  usually  by  email  as  an  attachment.
The  candidate  is  then  alerted  to  respond  to  the  mail  and  confirm  acceptance/rejection  of  the
employment offer as well as a suitable resumption date.
