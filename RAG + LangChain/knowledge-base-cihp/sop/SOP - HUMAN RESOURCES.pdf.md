CIHP Standard Operating Procedures

5.1  EMPLOYEE CLASSIFICATIONS

CIHP  has  several  classifications  for  its  employees  and  consultants/short  term  hires  as
summarized  below.    These  classifications  determine  the  compensation  and  benefits
provided.

When it is not clear  which classification a position or individual falls, especially in the
case of proposed consultants/short term hires, the office should seek assistance from the
Director of Management Support Services.

5.1.1   EMPLOYEE

Employees are citizens or permanent residents of the country where the position is based.
They are hired and paid by the organization and fall into one of the following categories:

1.  Full-time - An employee who works a standard work week (for example 40 hours a
week)  on  a  regular  basis,  in  accordance  with  local  standards  or  local  labor  laws.
Employees  in  this  category  are  entitled  to  CIHP  local  employee  benefits  on
confirmation, as outlined in the Employee Manual.

2.  Part-time - An employee who works less than a standard work week on a regular or
irregular basis.  Employee benefits may apply on a pro-rated basis or depending on
the service time and mutual agreement at the time of employment.  Should a part-time
employee consistently work more than his or her allotted hours, the Chief Executive
Officer and/or designee Director may determine that a change of classification should
be considered?

5.1.2  TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES

Temporary  employees  are  individuals  hired  by  CIHP  for  a  specific  and  limited  period,
often on need basis.  They may be expatriates or local hires.  These individuals are not
entitled to benefits provided to regular staff; however, benefits provided must be  stated
explicitly in the individuals’ hire letters and at the discretion of the CEO.

Temporary  hires  are  eligible  to  apply  for  vacant  positions  in  CIHP  as  contained  in  the
employee manual .Temporary employees may be hired for the following reasons:

To replace an employee who is on vacation, leave, or another short-term absence

•  To assist during peak work periods or with special projects
•  To fill a regular staff vacancy while CIHP is recruiting

Temporary  employees  are  distinct  from  consultants  in  that  they  do  not  necessarily
provide specialized services and they may fill defined staff positions and supervise other
staff members.

Section 5: Human Resources

January 2012, Page 5-4

CIHP Standard Operating Procedures

For  temporary  employees,  the  office  must  provide  the  employee  with  an  employment
letter that clearly specifies the nature of his/her employment, including status and length
of assignment.  The template must have prior review by legal counsel to ensure that the
Office is not entering into a contractual arrangement such as a service agreement.

5.1.3  CONSULTANT AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR

A consultant or independent contractor is an individual engaged by CIHP for his or her
specialized  technical,  program,  or  administrative  expertise  to  work  on  a  fee-for-service
basis.  Consultants are hired on a daily basis for a specific task and specific duration.  For
legal reasons, they must not be confused with staff, e.g., they must not be charged with
performing duties within an established job classification, or supervise staff.  The terms
of the consultancy must be defined in the Consulting Agreement in accordance with the
guidelines  in  Section  5.3  below,  with  distinction  given  to  international  consultants.
Consultants are not entitled to benefits.

5.2  EMPLOYEE RECRUITMENT AND HIRING

The standard staff recruitment process includes the following steps:

•  Agree on the position and profile
•  Develop the job description
•  Name a Job Point Person (JPP)
•  Obtain approval to hire
•  Draft advert script
•  Advertise the position vacancy internally and externally
•  Develop criteria for shortlist (sensitive to ethnicity, gender etc)
•  Shortlist and interview candidates
•  Obtain approval to offer employment
•  Offer employment

The operating procedures for each step are provided following this introduction.

These  standard  operating  procedures  assume  that  CIHP  is  handling  all  aspects  of
recruitment.  However, in special cases, the office may choose to hire a local recruiting
agency  to  advertise  positions,  identify  and  screen  candidates,  and  perform  other
recruitment services for CIHP.

5.2.1  JOB DESCRIPTIONS

To  begin  the  recruitment  process,  the  hiring  unit  Director  or  designate  must  develop  a
new  job  description  or  review  and  revise  an  existing  one.    Every  job  description  must
include:

Section 5: Human Resources

January 2012, Page 5-5

CIHP Standard Operating Procedures

1.  The position name, Unit, location , and supervisor
2.  A summary of the roles and responsibilities of the position
3.  A detailed list of the duties
4.  Minimum and preferred educational and skill requirements

Consistent job titles should be used at all CIHP’s Locations  .

If an  existing position is  vacated,  the  job  description  must  be  reviewed  and updated as
necessary  prior  to  its  submission  with  the  Job  Requisition  Form  and,  the  CIHP  Salary
scale level checked.

The hiring unit Director must obtain approval to draft a new job description by seeking
clearance from the CEO through the Senior HR/Admin Mgr.

Approval to hire must only be given once a complete job description exists.

5.2.2  JOB POINT PERSON

The hiring unit Director should appoint a single staff member to serve as the Job Point
Person  (JPP) or  communicate  that  the  role will be  covered by him  or herself.   The Job
Point  Person  is  responsible  for  working  with  Human  Resources  personnel  and  the
supervisor throughout the recruitment and hiring process.

5.2.3  JOB REQUISITIONS AND APPROVAL TO HIRE

Local Hires

All job openings require a Job Requisition Form. The following steps are required:

1.  The Job Point Person must complete the form and attaché the job description.
2.  The  supervisor  signs  his/her  approval  –  this  indicates  that  the  position,  whether
vacant or newly created, has been previously budgeted and approved by the CEO
3.  If a candidate has already been identified (e.g., a former consultant), the JPP must

note this on the form.

4.  The  job  level  must  be  noted  on  the  form  as  determined  by  the  Chief  Executive

Officer using the CIHP Salary Scale in the CIHP Remuneration Manual

5.  The Chief Executive Officer approves the job requisition and the job description.

In  some  instances,  in-country  representatives  of  the  funding  agency  may  wish  to  be
informed or involved in the hiring process.  In such cases, written correspondence should
be kept in the candidate’s file.

Section 5: Human Resources

January 2012, Page 5-6

CIHP Standard Operating Procedures

Expatriates

The  job  requisition  and  approval  process  for  expatriate  positions  in  CIHP  includes  the
following steps:

1.  The  Job  Point  Person  completes  the  Job  Requisition  Form  and  attach  the  job

description.

2.  The unit Director approves to indicate that the position, whether vacant or newly

created, has been previously budgeted and approved by CEO

3.  If a candidate has already been identified, the JPP will note this on the form on

the “Shortlist” line.

4.  The classification of the position must be noted on the form
5.  The CEO will approve the job requisition and job description and attached letter
outlining reasons why nationals could not fill the position (consideration of local
labor law limitations, if any, must be taken into account).

CIHP staff must use a Job Requisition Form with a review job description to request
for a hire.

5.2.4  POSTING AND ADVERTISING

Once  the  job  requisition  and  job  description  have  been  approved  by  all  parties,  the
Human Resource Unit may proceed with posting and advertising the position.

Internal  Posting:    Local  positions  must  be  posted  in  the  office  for  minimum  of  five
working days before interviews are concluded and a job offer is extended to a candidate.
If an internal candidate exists, under certain conditions the posting requirement may be
waived at the discretion of the Chief Executive Officer.

External  Advertising:    Once  the  job  description  has  been  approved,  the  Human
Resources  Unit  must  post  the  position  externally  using  the  best  method  for  advertising
positions, including local newspapers, the Internet, and local contacts.  Possible ways to
determine the most effective advertising avenues are to:  consult with other organizations,
check local newspapers to find where such advertisements are usually placed for this type
of  job,  and  research  online  alternatives.    Some  newspapers  or  other  sites  where  the
position  is  advertised  may  require  a  fee.    These  fees  are  allowable  costs  and  should  be
charged against the project to which the bulk of the position’s salary will be charged.

5.2.5  RECRUITMENT COSTS

Recruitment-related  costs  should  be  charged  to  the  appropriate  program  budget.
Recruitment  costs  may  include  job-advertising  expenses,  recruiting-agency  fees,  and
travel expenses incurred by candidates who are brought to CIHP offices for interviews.

Section 5: Human Resources

January 2012, Page 5-7

CIHP Standard Operating Procedures

Reimbursement of candidates’ travel expenses is not routine and may only occur when all
three of the following circumstances exist:

•  The position is a higher-level one
•  Funds exist in the budget to cover the costs
•  The Chief Executive Officer gives prior approval to reimbursing the candidate’s

travel expenses

All candidates should be told – prior to traveling to CIHP offices – whether or not their
travel  expenses  will  be  reimbursed.    Such  correspondence  should  be  kept  with  their
interview paperwork.

5.2.6  INTERNAL TRANSFERS

CIHP  welcomes  and  encourages  qualified  employees  to  apply  for  internal  vacancies
when  they  occur.    Applicants  for  transfers  must  be  given  equal  consideration  and  be
subject to the same review and interview process as other candidates.

If a vacancy is filled through a transfer, a salary and or level adjustment will be made as
appropriate in accordance with CIHP salary guidelines.

5.2.7  SCREENING APPLICANTS

For local positions, as candidates submit letters and CVs (or resumés), Human Resources
Unit  will  forward  CV’s  to  the  Job  Point  Person  who  takes  the  lead  on  reviewing
submissions  to  determine  whether  candidates  meet  the  job  specifications  outlined.    For
those  who  are  qualified,  the  JPP  may  conduct  telephone  interviews  or  in-person
interviews to assess further how well the candidates might perform in the job.  If there is
no interest in a candidate, the Human Resource Unit will follow appropriate procedure in
responding  to  applicants,  e.g.,  by  sending  a  letter  indicating  no  interest  or  by  not
providing  any  notification,  having  stated  in  the  advertisement  that  only  successful
applicants  will  be  contacted.  All  unsuccessful  applicants  interviewed  must  be  notified
within three (3) weeks of the interview date

A file must be set up for each individual for whom an interview is scheduled.  This file
must include:  the job description, the candidate’s CV and cover letter; a completed bio-
data  form,  copies  of  credentials;  and  the  final  offer  or  decline  letter.    In  addition,  a
separate  file  must  be  set  up  that  includes  all  CVs  received  that  were  rejected,  with
documentation – if any – of the rejection letter, phone call, or e-mail message.

Section 5: Human Resources

January 2012, Page 5-8

CIHP Standard Operating Procedures

5.2.8  INTERVIEWING

The Human Resource Unit will work with the Job Point Person to determine who should
be involved in the interview process and send each interviewer the job application pack.
It  is  the  Human  Resource  Unit’s  responsibility  to  invite  candidate’s  shortlisted  for
interview

All CIHP offices must comply with laws governing appropriate interview questions (e.g.,
individual’s  race,  religion,  ethnic
prohibitions  against  questions  concerning  an
consideration, or age).

5.2.9  SELECTION AND OFFER

Selection

At the conclusion of the interview process, the Human Resources Unit should organize a
short  meeting  or  conference  call  with  the  interviewers  to  review  the  candidates’
qualifications and select a finalist.  If interviewers are not available for a meeting or call,
their opinions may be collected in some other way, e.g., through e-mailed comments, and
a conclusion reached on the finalist with the key parties, which are the supervisor, JPP,
human  resources  staff,  and  specific  Directors  as  called  for  (e.g.,  the  Chief  Executive
Officer)

Reference Checks

CIHP  will  perform  reference  checks  on  prospective  employees.    Communications  with
references must be documented and placed in the candidate’s file.

Salary Offer

For  local  hires,  if  references  are  acceptable,  the  Director  of  Management  Support
Services determines what salary will be offered, in accordance with the CIHP salary scale
level  of  the  position  according  to  the  CIHP  Remuneration  Manual  and  in  consultation,
with  the  Director  of  Finance  &  Subcontract  and  approval  sought  from  the  Chief
Executive  Officer.    In  cases  of  senior  positions,  the  proposed  salary  must  first  be
discussed and approved by the Chief Executive Officer.  See Section 5.4 below for more
information on compensation.

New employees must be considered for a hiring salary that is at least the minimum of the
salary  range  (CIHP),  depending  on  how  completely  their  qualifications  meet  the
requirements  of  the  position.    A  verbal  offer  may  first  be  made  to  the  candidate  to
ascertain expectation.

Section 5: Human Resources

January 2012, Page 5-9

CIHP Standard Operating Procedures

Once  the  offer  is  made  and  accepted,  Human  Resource  Associate  must  send  a  letter  of
employment  signed  by  the  Chief  Executive  Officer.    This  letter  must  include  the
following:

•  Position title
•  Place of employment and area of work (including the need for travel)
•  Complete position description (attach the job description)
•  Starting salary and currency
•  Complete compensation package
•  Title of supervisor
•  Start date
•  Requirement of acceptance of Employee Manual and Organizational procedures

& SOPs

•  Signature of Chief Executive Officer

The Human Resource Associate  must have the new employee counter-sign the letter of
employment,  give  one  copy  to  the  employee,  and  place  the  original  in  the  employee’s
record in CIHP files.

The hire letter and supervisor must make clear to a new employee that job functions may
change during the program life, and CIHP has the right to make such changes with little
or no notice.

 Nepotism

Relatives  of  employees  are  generally  considered  for  employment  based  on  their  qualifications.
However, where the employment of a worker’s family member results in the types of prohibited
employment  relationships  identified  below,  CIHP  will  not  consider  or  accept  applications  for
employment.

Hiring of family members is prohibited if employment results in the creation of:
-  A  supervisory/subordinate  relationship  between  family  members.  If  a  direct  supervisory  or
managerial relationship would be established, family members of a current employee cannot be
considered for an open position.

-  An  actual  conflict  of  interest  or  the  appearance  of  a  conflict  of  interest.  Generally,  this  bars
employment of an employee’s family member who has an auditing or control relationship to the
employee’s job.

Employees are responsible for full disclosure of any such relationships at the time of hire. Failure
to  disclose  such  relationships  will  constitute  grounds  for  disciplinary  actions  including
termination.

Employees  who  marry  or  establish  a  close  personal  relationship  (with  an  imminent  view  to
marry) cannot continue in their current positions. If the situations specified above does occur, the
employees will be permitted to determine which one of them will resign within a specified period
not  exceeding  3  months.  If  neither  party  resigns  CIHP  reserves  the  right  to  terminate  the

Section 5: Human Resources

January 2012, Page 5-10

CIHP Standard Operating Procedures

employment  of  both  for  operational  requirements.  See  the  next  sub-section  below  for  more
information.

Candidates Not Selected

It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Human  Resource  Associate  to  contact  all  candidates  that
were interviewed but not selected to inform them of this fact.  The means of contact may
be  a  letter  or  an  e-mail  message.    A  hard  copy  of  the  communication  to  the  candidate
must be printed and included in the recruitment‘s file.

5.2.10

SPECIAL EMPLOYMENT CIRCUMSTANCES

Employment of Persons with Disabilities

In  compliance  with  applicable  laws,  CIHP  makes  reasonable  accommodations  to  the
known physical or mental limitations of otherwise qualified individuals with disabilities,
unless doing so would impose undue hardship on CIHP as an institution or pose a direct
threat  to  the  health  or  safety  of  the  individual  or  others.   An  otherwise  qualified
individual with a disability is a person who, with or without reasonable accommodation,
can  meet  all  of  the  selection  criteria  and  perform  all  of  the  essential  functions  of  an
employment position held or desired.

Employment of Persons Who Use Illicit Drugs

CIHP  will  not knowingly  employ  persons  currently  using  illicit  drugs.  Also,  CIHP’s
policy on drugs and alcohol prohibits the possession, use, manufacture, and distribution
of illicit drugs on CIHP premises.

5.2.11

VISAS AND WORK PERMITS

The  Director  of  Management  Support  Services  and  new  business  must  contact  legal
counsel or an appropriate agency to begin the process of obtaining visas for the employee
and accompanying family members and a work permit for the employee, as soon as the
decision  is  made  to  hire  an  expatriate,  if  necessary.    After  consulting  the  appropriate
authorities to determine the average time it takes to obtain the necessary documents, the
Director of Management Support Services and new business should inform the employee.

While the visa and work permit are being requested, the employee must contact the Snr.
HR/Admin  Manager  to  begin  the  process  of  arranging  for  the  packing,  storing,  and
shipping of household goods for the move to the destination country, in accordance with
CIHP’s Policies and Procedures.

Section 5: Human Resources

January 2012, Page 5-11

CIHP Standard Operating Procedures

If a candidate is hired, and difficulty in securing a visa or work permit delays the start of
an  assignment  as  planned,  CIHP  may  seek  to  find  the  new  employee  a  temporary
assignment until the visa or work permit issues are resolved.

An  expatriate  employee  must  not  work  in  his/her  assigned  location  before  that  country
has issued the necessary work permit, unless work under a temporary visa is possible and
would not endanger the work permit process.

5.3  CONTRACTING CONSULTANTS

If the determination is made that consultants are to be used, they must be for short-term
assignments  documented  by  an  agreement  and  scope  of  work,  and  approved  by  the
funding agency.

5.3.1  CONTRACTING LOCAL CONSULTANTS

Local  consultants  are  paid  directly  by  CIHP  at  a  rate  determined  in  accordance  with
prevailing local rates for similar work.  Any deviation from these rates, whether higher or
lower, requires written justification approved by the Chief Executive Officer.

In  advance  of  the  consultancy,  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  consultant  must  sign  a
consultant  letter  detailing  the  consultant’s  scope  of  work  and  specifying  the  maximum
number of  approved days and daily rate of pay.  Consultants  will receive no additional
benefits, with the exception of per diem for travel outside their area of residence during
their consultancy.

Consultant  Files:    The  Human  Resource  Associate  must  maintain  a  complete  file  for
each consultant, including:

•  The Consultant Approval Request Form and all attachments
•  The signed Consultant Letter, Bio Data, CV, and Credentials
•  All other correspondence with the consultant
•  All funding agency correspondence and approvals

The  Office  must  provide  each  local  consultant  with  CIHP’s  template  of  a  Local
Consultant Invoice for use when submitting bills for service.

5.3.2  CONTRACTING INTERNATIONAL CONSULTANTS

When contracting an international consultant, the following steps must be taken.

Section 5: Human Resources

January 2012, Page 5-12

CIHP Standard Operating Procedures

Step  1  -  Scope  of  Work:    The  hiring  unit  in  collaboration  with  the  Senior  HR/Admin
Manager determines the need for an international consultant, and drafts a scope of work
that specifies the tasks, the budget, and the length of the consultancy.

If  appropriate,  the  Director  of  Support  Services  and  New  Business  shares  the  proposed
SOW after CEO’s approval with in-country representatives of funding agencies for their
information or concurrence.

Step 2  -  Identification  and  Selection  of Consultant:    The Human Resources Associate
works  with  program  staff  to  collect  CVs  and  select  the  consultant.    For  a  competitive
selection process, at least 3 CVs must be considered (see the next page below for more
information).

Step 3 - Preparation of Documentation:

1.  The  Human  Resources  Associate  obtains  from  the  consultant  a  completed
the

Contractor  Employee  Biographical  Data  Sheet,  which  must
consultant’s daily rate based on prior salary history.

justify

2.  The Human Resources Associate completes a Consultant Approval Request Form
to provide the information required for approval by CEO and funding agency.

Step 4 - Funding Agency Approval:  When funding agency approval is required, Human
Resources Associate completes the Consultant Approval Request Form with all required
attachments:    Scope  of  Work  specifying  the  budget  and  length  of  consultancy,
Biographical  Data  Sheet,  CV  of  the  consultant,  and  relevant  budget  page  showing  the
account  number  and  the  consultant’s  rate  and  travel  and  miscellaneous  costs.    The
Director  Management  Support  Services  and  New  Business  forwards  the  requisition
information to  the appropriate  Grants  Management  Specialist  at the  funding  agency  for
approval.    Once  the  agency  approves,  the  Director  Management  Support  Services  and
New  Business  forwards  the  funding  agency  approval  e-mail  to  the  Chief  Executive
Officer, Senior Human Resources/Admin Manager and Senior Finance Manager.

Step 5 – File Maintenance:  The Senior HR/Admin Manager creates and maintains a file
for each consultant with all relevant documentation, including:

•  The Consultant Approval Request Form and all attachments
•  All correspondence with the consultant
•  All funding agency correspondence and approvals
•  Signed Payment/Requisitions Approval Checklist
•  Purchase Order

Human Resources Associate will also create a file with the consultant’s CV, Biographical
Data Sheet, and consultancy letter and acceptance of assignment.

Step  6  –  Consultant  Letter  and  Agreement:    The  Senior  Human  Resources/Admin
Manager generates and a Consultant Agreement Letter for the CEO’s approval and send

Section 5: Human Resources

January 2012, Page 5-13

CIHP Standard Operating Procedures

approved letter to the consultant.  The letter will detail the consultant’s scope of work and
specifies the maximum number of approved days and daily rate of pay.  Consultants will
receive no additional benefits with the exception of per diem for travel outside their area
of residence during their consultancy (see Section 5.3.4 below).

The Consultant Agreement Letter and any other communication must make it clear to all
consultants that the consultant, not CIHP, is responsible for paying taxes on consultancy
income.

5.3.3  CONSULTANT TRAVEL

Consultants  must  know  before  traveling  which  expenses  are  reimbursable,  and  how  to
properly report  and document  those  expenses.   Consultants  will be given  a  copy of  the
relevant  travel  guidelines  along  with  the  Consultant  Agreement  Letter.    Technical  staff
supervising  the  consultancy  may  need  to  assist  consultants  in  interpreting  the  travel
guidelines or to refer consultants to the Administrative Officer for assistance.

5.3.4  PERFORMANCE ISSUES

If  a  consultant  is  found  to  be  ineffective  or  his/her  skills  are  inadequate  for  the
assignment, the supervisor of that consultant should contact the appropriate Program or
Unit  Director  or  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  to  discuss  whether  to  terminate  the
assignment.    Any  documentation  associated  with  inadequate  performance  and  the
termination process must be placed on file.

EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION

Compensation  levels  and  benefit  packages  must  be  in  accordance  with  statutory
requirements in the country and in line with CIHP remuneration manual

5.3.5  SALARY ADMINISTRATION

CIHP’s policy is to compensate  staff in accordance with the CIHP’s compensation plan
as outlined in the Remuneration Manual.  .

All  employees  and  contracts  staff  must  state  and  pay  salaries  in  local  currency  unless
otherwise approved by the Chief Executive Officer.

CIHP’s goal is to ensure that the  compensation plan that attracts and retains employees.
As  such,  CIHP  reserves  the  right  to  adjust  salaries  as  necessary  either  because  of
individual circumstances or to ensure that CIHP’s plan remains competitive in the local
market,  within  available  resources.    The  HR  unit  may  conduct  an  annual  review  of

Section 5: Human Resources

January 2012, Page 5-14

CIHP Standard Operating Procedures

salaries; if the results indicate need to deviate from the CIHP salary scale and funds are
available for such salary adjustments, such changes must be justified and approved by the
CEO.  For  audit  purposes,  the  Human  Resource  Associate  must  maintain  in  its  files  all
documentation associated with the proposed salary adjustments.

5.3.6  HIRING SALARY

New  employees  normally  will  be  considered  for  a  hiring  salary  that  is  at  least  the
minimum  of  the  salary  range  for  the  position,  depending  on  how  completely  their
qualifications meet the requirements of the position.

OVERTIME

All  -hire  positions  are  considered  to  be  salaried,  rather  than  paid  on  an  hourly  or  daily
basis,  and  are  usually  not  eligible  for  overtime  pay.    Therefore,  from  time  to  time,
employees  may  be  expected  to  work  longer  than  the  standard  workweek  without
additional compensation.

CIHP does not expect, require, or encourage any of its employees to work overtime. However,
under certain circumstances during times of heavy program activity, the staff may need to work
beyond normal hours or during weekends to complete an assignment with no additional
remuneration. CIHP does not pay any overtime unless exceptionally approved by the Chief
Executive Officer.

Drivers,  Cleaners,  Stores  Assistants  and  Office  Assistants  are  entitled  to  overtime  when
exceptionally approved. Where overtime is approved the pay rate will be hourly basic pay rate X
1.5.

5.3.7  COST-OF-LIVING AND MERIT INCREASES

The office may give its employees cost-of-living increases if these adjustments have prior
approval from the funding agency.

These SOPs do not dictate if and when these increases should be given nor what level of
increase  is  permitted.    Instead,  the  policies  and  procedures  for  the  increases  must  be
determined by the CEO as recommended by the Director of Support Services and New
Business, in accordance with labor laws, and as documented in CIHP Employee Manual
and Remuneration Policy.

5.3.8  MERIT AND PROMOTION INCREASES

Section 5: Human Resources

January 2012, Page 5-15

CIHP Standard Operating Procedures

Merit  Increases:    It  is  recommended  that  the  Human  Resource  Unit  have  performance
management system where all employees are evaluated systematically on an annual basis.
The system must provide a consistent and equitable basis for making decisions regarding
merit increase and must be based on performance

Promotion  Increases:    A  promotion  is  defined  as  an  increase  in  a  position's
responsibilities substantive enough to warrant a change in the job description and salary.
The  position's  qualifications  and  performance  requirements  should  be  consistent  with
other higher-level positions, as demonstrated in the new job description. Employees are
eligible for a promotion into a higher-level position only after they have been employed
for a minimum of 12 months.

A  Unit  Director  seeking  a  promotion  for  a  staff  member  should  submit  a  justification
requesting to the Chief Executive Officer’s approval.  The request must include a new job
description  and  how  the  employee  has  met  the  higher  level  performance  standard  the
employee should be informed only after approval has been given by the CEO.

Any promotion increase granted should be dependent on such factors as:

Individual's qualifications in relation to similar positions

•
•  Position of employee’s salary in new salary range
•  Time since last salary increase
•  Time until next salary increase

5.3.9  ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUSTMENTS

CIHP reserves the right to make adjustments to an employee’s salary, benefits, or grade
level, as well as to make across-the-board adjustment to salaries and benefits.  Examples
include adjusting an employee’s grade level or salary to bring it in line with those applied
to other positions in the office.  Administrative adjustments must be supported by proper
documentation with approval signatures.

5.3.10

SALARY ADVANCES

Employees may not receive advance payments against future salaries.  In the rare case
that the office feels an exception is warranted, this requires the explicit approval of the
Chief Executive Officer.

Salary  advances  are  neither  a  “benefit”  nor  a  "right"  of  employment;  it  is  for  truly
exceptional  emergency  purposes  and  may  not  exceed  ten  per  cent  (10%)  of  the
employee’s annual salary.  The advance must be cleared within six months of issuance or
by termination of employment, whichever is the earliest.

The procedure is as follows:

Section 5: Human Resources

January 2012, Page 5-16

CIHP Standard Operating Procedures

1.  For approval of an exception, the employee submits a description of the need and
proposed amount of the advance to the Chief Executive Officer for consideration.
2.  Once  approval  is  given,  the  employee  signs  an  advance  form  that  stipulates  the

amount, term of the advance, and repayment procedures.

3.  Once the form is completed, signed, and approved, the advance is issued by the

finance staff.

4.  Repayment is made through salary deductions over the course of a maximum of

six months.

5.  If  the  employee  leaves  prior  to  full  repayment,  the  balance  is  deducted  from

his/her final paycheck.

6.  The total deduction from an employee’s salary must not be more than one-third of

total earning

7.  Where  the  employee’s  final  pay  cheque  is  less  than  the  advance,  the  total
outstanding must be repaid in full before the last day of employment with CIHP

The Director of Finance & Subcontracts must carefully track approval, disbursement, and
monitoring of repayment.

5.3.11

EMPLOYMENT TAXES

The Employee Manual documents the requirements under labor law for handling program
income  and  other  employment-related  taxes,  and  provides  specific  procedures  used  by
CIHP.

5.4  EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

This  sub-section  covers  employee  benefits  for  both  expatriates  and  local  hires,  with
distinctions made as necessary.  Sections 5.5.1 through 5.5.6 cover paid leave, while the
remainder covers other benefits.

5.4.1  VACATION LEAVE

The office establishes – in accordance with local law and practice and as documented in
the Employee Manual – the maximum of working days of annual leave that an employee
may  earn  per  year  and  the  maximum  days  that  may  be  accrued.    Unused  annual  leave
may be carried over to the next leave year provided that the maximum accrued leave is
not exceeded.

All requests for annual leave from employees should be made two weeks in advance and
in writing to the employee’s supervisor.  Annual leave taken in advance is generally not
allowed.    Unless  prior  written  approval  is  given  by  the  Chief  Executive  Officer.    Any

Section 5: Human Resources

January 2012, Page 5-17

CIHP Standard Operating Procedures

accrued (unused) annual leave will be paid out at the time of termination of employment
to a maximum number of days that may be accrued.

All staff members should liaise  with their supervisors to plan vacation leave for a time
convenient  for  CIHP,  as  possible  (e.g.,  by  avoiding    vacation  when  there  is  a  new
programmatic initiative or important deadline).

5.4.2  HOLIDAYS

At the beginning of each fiscal year, which begins Oct  1st (or as maybe amended), the
office  must disseminate a  memo  with  a  list  of holidays that will be observed  that year.
The  list  will  usually  include  all  official  national  holidays  and  may  also  include  other
designated days to be decided by the Chief Executive Officer.

If a holiday falls within the period of an employee’s approved paid leave, he/she will not
be charged leave on the holiday.

5.4.3  SICK LEAVE

The purpose of sick leave is to provide time off with pay when an illness or an accident
makes it medically unadvisable for the employee to work and to provide for a temporary
period  of  recuperation.    In  order  for  employees  to  qualify  for  more  than  two  days’
consecutive  paid  sick  leave,  the  employee  must  provide  the  office  with  a  medical
certificate  from  a  registered  medical  practitioner.    An  employee  is  entitled  to  12  days’
paid sick leave per year of continuous employment with CIHP.
Sick leave cannot be carried over to the following year.

5.4.4  PARENTAL LEAVE

Human Resources manual provides for maternity leave as required under the labour law.
CIHP  may determine whether or not to provide paternity leave, ensuring that the policy
developed and documented in the Employee Manual is reasonable and in accordance with
any related provisions in  labor law.

5.4.5  LEAVE WITHOUT PAY

Full time employees who  have completed 12 months of service may be granted a leave
of absence for personal reasons, without pay, not  exceeding one (1) month within a year ,
and at the discretion of the Chief Executive Officer.  Employee benefits and accruals of
holiday time will be suspended during the Leave without Pay period.

An employee who has been granted a leave of absence for personal reasons must  return
to  the  same  position upon  completion of  the  leave or  a  position of  equivalent  rank  and
salary within the same Unit.

Section 5: Human Resources

January 2012, Page 5-18

CIHP Standard Operating Procedures

5.4.6  OTHER BENEFITS

Full time employees may be provided  with  health insurance and reimbursement, end of
service  benefits  ,  13th-month  pay,  life  insurance,  personal  accident  insurance,  a
death/funeral payment and  or other benefits.   Following the law and reflecting standard
practice,  the  office  must  document  personnel  benefits  clearly  in  the  Employee  Manual
and ensure careful review by the legal counsel prior to implementation.

5.5  WORKING CONDITIONS

This  sub-section  covers  standard  operating  procedures  for  normal  working  conditions.
See  also  Section  5.14  below  for  SOPs  on  staff  safety  and  security,  which  provides
precautionary measures to reduce risk of harm to CIHP staff.

5.5.1  PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT

The place of employment shall be the Center for Integrated Health Programs (CIHP) at
the location specified in the employee’s hire letter as determined by the Chief Executive
Officer. Staff may be reassigned to another location  in order to meet changing needs of
the organization.

5.5.2  OFFICE AND WORK SCHEDULE

Except where otherwise specified, official working hours of operation are from 8:00 a.m.
to  5:00  p.m.,  Monday  through  Friday,  with  a  one-hour  lunch  break  each  day.    This  is
equivalent to a 40-hour workweek.

Employees may be able to arrange flexible work schedules in consultation with the Chief
Executive Officer, subject to the convenience of the office.

Within  the  context  of  the  40-hour  workweek,  support  staff,  such  as  secretaries,
receptionists,  office  assistants,  and  drivers,  may  be  asked  to  modify  their  starting  and
ending  work  times  or  the  timing  or  duration  of  their  lunch  break  to  accommodate  the
needs of the office.

5.5.3  ATTENDANCE AND TARDINESS

Regular, punctual attendance is essential for effective performance by both the employee
and members of his/her team.  Employees are expected to report to work on time and to
return from lunch break promptly.

Section 5: Human Resources

January 2012, Page 5-19

CIHP Standard Operating Procedures

Supervisors  are  responsible  for  monitoring  the  punctuality  and  attendance  of  all
employees  during  working  hours.    Supervisors  must  ensure  that  the  attendance  and
absence  policy  is  applied  consistently  and  attendance-related  disciplinary  actions  are
documented clearly, carefully, and promptly.  Attendance problems should be reflected in
employee performance evaluations and reported to the Senior HR/Admin Manager

There may be occasions, however, when emergencies or other circumstances prevent an
employee from reporting to work as scheduled.  In such cases, the employee is expected
to call the office by 9:30 a.m. and inform his/her supervisor of the situation.

Employees  who  are  absent  from  work  and  fail  to  contact  their  supervisors  for  three
consecutive days will be considered to have resigned from duty and their services may be
terminated  if  investigations  do  not  reveal  any  justifiable  reason  for  their  absence  and
inability to contact the office.

Whenever possible, staff members who are absent should make arrangements to have any
critical  work  assignments  covered  by  someone  else,  and  let  the  supervisor  know  what
critical tasks are pending and what must be done in their absence.

5.5.4  PAY PERIOD

Salaries are paid on a monthly basis, on the 25th of every month payments must be made
by either cheque or direct deposit.

5.5.5  TIME ATTENDANCE REPORTING

Time  attendance  and  effort  reporting  is  important  to  support  corresponding  salary
payments for pay periods.  Timesheets also serve as documentation in support of charges
to grants and contracts.  Furthermore, they are used to verify sick leave, personal holidays,
and vacation allowances.

By 21st of every month all employees must submit completed, signed Monthly Time and
Effort Sheet to their supervisors for review, verification, and approval, as documented by
the supervisor’s and/or Chief Executive Officer’s signature on the timesheet.

UNSCHEDULED OR EMERGENCY OFFICE CLOSURES

The Chief Executive Officer may officially delay opening, close early, or close the office
for  the  entire  day  due  to  unplanned  events  or  circumstances  that  would  prevent
employees  from  safely,  effectively,  or  appropriately  performing  their  duties  (e.g.,
inclement weather, sustained power failure, fire, political unrest, or national mourning).
When an office officially closes, employees who were scheduled to work must use code
“X” on their timesheets to account for hours not worked.  Normal remuneration applies in
such instances.

Section 5: Human Resources

January 2012, Page 5-20

CIHP Standard Operating Procedures

5.6  COVERAGE DURING ABSENCES

Each  employee  should  provide  advance  information  if  he  or  she  will  be  absent  due  to
vacation, maternity leave, travel, or other leave.  He/she is responsible for communicating
to  relevant  parties  who  will  cover  for  him/her  and  what  specific  authorities  have  been
delegated, if any.

For  example,  in  his/her  out-of-the-office  e-mail  message,  the  employee  should  provide
the expected length of absence, contact information, and who is providing coverage.  The
employee should provide this same information on his/her telephone message system(s).

In the case of staff who deals regularly with other partner/donor offices, the notification
should be shared with these contacts.

they  do  not  necessarily  receive  additional  compensation  at  a

In the case of a staff member’s extended absence, the Chief Executive Officer may want
to  appoint  someone  in  an  “acting”  capacity  in  that  job.    When  employees  are  in  acting
level
positions,
commensurate with their interim responsibilities.  Depending on budget availability and
other factors, the Chief Executive Officer may choose to implement a temporary salary
adjustment for the entire duration of an acting assignment if the following conditions are
met:  the position is a management one, the acting assignment will last for at least one
month, and the position is at a higher grade than that of the person’s usual job.

ORIENTATION AND STAFF DEVELOPMENT

5.6.1  ORIENTATION

Once a start date has been determined, the Snr. HR/Administration Manager must arrange
an orientation for the new staff member.

Every  new  employee’s  primary  supervisor  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  he/she  is
properly oriented on the new job and working environment.  Orientation should include:

•  An overview of CIHP
•  Team structure
•  Project goals
•  Employment conditions
•  Specific information about compensation and benefits
•  CIHP’s codes of conduct
•

Information about the working environment

Depending on the employee’s position, orientation should also cover:

•  Subrecipient management
•  Grant/contract regulations

Section 5: Human Resources

January 2012, Page 5-21

CIHP Standard Operating Procedures

The  appropriate  manuals  must  be  distributed  to  and/or  reviewed  with  new  hires  at
orientation.    The  organizer  of  the  orientation  must  provide  the  employee  with  an
orientation checklist that shows the steps that must be completed to properly orient a new
hire to CIHP in general, as well as to the particulars of his/her position and office.

5.6.2  STAFF DEVELOPMENT

It is CIHP’s policy to provide employees that have completed 12 months in employment
opportunities  to  develop  or  improve  their  skills  and  knowledge  consistent  with  CIHP
program  objectives.      Such  skill  or  knowledge  improvement  will  generally  relate  to
improvements in an employee’s ability to perform current job tasks.

The  organization’s  staff  development  program  may  include  internal  opportunities,  such
as in-house training workshops, staff exchanges, mentoring, and on-the-job training.  In
the  case  of  external  opportunities,  the  procedure  for  review  and  approval  depends  on
whether the opportunity is in-country or abroad.  These procedures are described below.

Procedure for  Staff Development Opportunity

1.  If  an  employee  and  his/her  supervisor  identify  an  external  professional
development  opportunity  ,  such  as  a  training  workshop,  language  course,  or
professional  seminar,  they  must  submit  a  brief  proposal  to  the  CEO  through
Director of Support Service and New Business addressing the following points:

•  Description  of  how  the  course/training/workshop  would  strengthen  the

employee’s skills

•  Evidence that the course is relevant to the employee’s present responsibilities
•  Timeframe, including travel time
•  A  proposal  for  which  grant/contract  will  fund  the  staff  development

opportunity

•  Cost of the activities, including fees, travel, and other expenses for which the

employee will be reimbursed

2.  The proposal is submitted for approval to the Chief Executive Officer for review

and approval

3.  The Chief Executive Officer provides approval in writing.
4.  Within  a  month  of  the  training,  the  employee  prepares  a  presentation  and/or
written report to educate other staff in their office about what they have learned
and implications for the program.

Procedure for a Staff Development Opportunity Abroad

The  same  steps  must  be  followed  for  a  staff  development  opportunity  abroad  (such  as
training  workshops),  but  in  addition,  the  applicant  and  those  approving  the  opportunity
must be familiar with and follow CIHP’s policy on travel to professional conferences and
travel for purposes of continuing medical education credit (see the next sub-section).

Section 5: Human Resources

January 2012, Page 5-22

CIHP Standard Operating Procedures

Note:  Completion of training programs does not imply an automatic promotion, a salary
increase, or advantages based on criteria other than job performance.

5.6.3  TRAVEL TO CONFERENCES AND FOR EDUCATION CREDIT

CIHP is committed to encouraging and enabling staff to participate in and contribute to
scientific  and  professional  conferences  whenever  possible.    CIHP  senior  management
must carefully review requests from staff to attend conferences.  They must be careful to
identify  the  source  of  funding  for  conference  attendance  and  comply  with  any  funding
agency’s  prior  approval  requirements  for  conference-related  travel  and  other  expenses.
Prioritization  of  conferences,  and  of  staff  members  to  attend  those  conferences,  will  be
based on value to CIHP as a whole.

The  following  summarizes  policies  and  procedures  concerning  staff  attendance  at
professional conferences.

1.  CIHP may fund attendance at other appropriate conferences by staff members for
where  such  attendance  is  directly  related  to  job  duties  and  responsibilities,
depending on availability of funding and other factors.

2.  First preference for attendance at conferences will be given to staff members who
have  papers  accepted  for  presentation.
  Given  funding  limitations,  paid
participation  by  staff  members  not  making  presentations  will  be  relatively  rare.
Note that acceptance of a paper for presentation does not guarantee that funds will
be available for travel and other expenses.

3.  The following procedure applies to conference participation:

•  Staff  members  wishing  to  attend  appropriate  conferences  should  present  a
brief,  written  request  to  his/her  supervisor  describing  the  name  and  dates  of
the  conference,  the  nature  of  his/her  participation  (e.g.,  whether  or  not  an
abstract will be submitted), and the approximate cost of attendance.

•  The supervisor determines the appropriateness of the conference and the staff
member’s  attendance.    The  supervisor  then  determines  (in  consultation  with
CIHP  leadership)  whether  or  not  funding  is  available.    (Approval  may  be
contingent on acceptance of an abstract.)
If  attendance  is  approved  in  principle  for  an  international  conference,  the
Office  seeks  from  the  funding  agency  any  required  approval  for  attendance
and for the travel.

•

4.  Staff  members  attending  conferences  at  CIHP  expense  are  required  to  submit  a
report on conference activities and key issues for the benefit of staff who do not
attend.    (If  multiple  staff  attends,  a  joint  report  and/or  presentation  should  be
made.)  Staff members are also encouraged to utilize the web-casts that are often
available from various conferences as well as the conference updates that usually
follow major conferences.

Section 5: Human Resources

January 2012, Page 5-23

CIHP Standard Operating Procedures

Staff  members  who  are  required  to  earn  continuing  professional  education  credits  for
licensure  or  other  purposes  are  encouraged  to  earn  these  credits  through  means  that  do
not  require  travel  and/or  conference  attendance,  such  as  through  web-based  and  print-
based options.

Staff members who wish to attend work-related conferences at their own expense may do
so  if  other  duties  will  not  be  compromised.    Any  time  spent  away  from  regular  duties
must  be  discussed  in  advance  with  the  employee’s  supervisor.    If  the  conference  is
sufficiently relevant to job duties, and if other work will not be compromised, the Chief
Executive  Officer  –  upon  the  recommendation  of  the  employee’s  supervisor  –  may
approve  the  use  of  work  time  for  attendance.    Otherwise,  vacation  time  must  be  used.
OFFICE STAFFING STRUCTURE

Each  office  will  have  a  staffing  structure  that  allows  for  optimal  management  of
programs.    Roles,  responsibilities,  and  lines  of  authority  should  be  clear,  documented,
and well communicated.

Offices are required to have a current organizational chart readily available to all staff.

5.7  MEMBERSHIPS

CIHP does not reimburse employees for memberships in professional organizations.

5.8  PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT

The  formal  performance  appraisal  process  aims  to  provide  both  employees  and  their
supervisors with a clear understanding of expectations for the job.  This practice allows
employees  and  their  supervisors  to  benchmark  the  employee’s  ability  to  meet
expectations and goals, and provide an accurate means for measuring future improvement.

5.8.1  PROBATIONARY PERIOD

The  probationary  period  for  newly  hired  employees  is  typically  90  days.      The
probationary period is a trial period during which the new employee and the supervisor
have  an  opportunity  to  evaluate  the  employee’s  interest,  qualifications,  attitude  and
performance under actual working conditions.  During this time, a foundation should be
set for objectives and performance standards required and on which an employee will be
evaluated.

 While an employee is on probation, she/he will be evaluated on an ongoing basis. It is
important for line managers to provide regular feedback to new employees during this
probation period through discussions on job tasks, identification of employee strengths
and weakness and suggestions on purposeful approaches for meeting performance targets
and objectives.  The supervisor or line manager is advised to hold a formal performance

Section 5: Human Resources

January 2012, Page 5-24

CIHP Standard Operating Procedures

review meeting with the new staff after the initial six weeks of employment. At the end
of 90 days period, a formal evaluation will be conducted and a decision made on whether
to confirm the employment contract, extend the probation or terminate the employment
contract. Where the employee’s performance during the probation period is not
satisfactory, the probation period may be extended at the discretion of the Chief
Executive Officer subject to a maximum three months extension beyond the initial 90
days. Any extension of probation must be in writing and the reasons for extension
documented.

If at the end of the extension period his/ her performance is still not up to the required
standard CIHP may terminate his/her employment with 2 weeks written notice.

The  end  of  the  probationary  period  will  be  signified  by  a  satisfactorily  completed
performance  evaluation  and  a  formal  letter  of  interim  confirmation  issued  to  the  staff.
Final confirmation will only be given to new hires following verification of academic and
professional credentials.
Confirmation of an employee will be signed by the Chief Executive Officer or delegated
authority.

5.8.2  PERFORMANCE APPRAISALS

Performance appraisals must be conducted at least once per year according to a regular
schedule approved by the CEO as recommended by the Director of Support Service and
New Business, this must be documented.
If the organization needs to modify the approach and/or appraisal tool to better meet their
needs, the following guidelines apply:

•  The  selected  format  must  provide  for  a  comparison  of  actual  performance  with

established expectations.

•  The format must have a space for employee comments.
•  The process must include a review of the employee’s job description and updating

of it as needed.

•  The  process  must  include  at  least  one  meeting  between  the  employee  and

supervisor to discuss the appraisal.

•  The employee and supervisor must both sign the appraisal.
•  Specific activities, performance measurements, and timelines for the coming year
must be developed and agreed upon between the employee and his/her supervisor.
•  The  original,  completed,  signed  document  must  be  filed  by  the  HR  unit  and  a

copy given to the staff member for his/her personal records.

 Special Note:

•

Information contained in a performance evaluation is personal and must be treated
with great sensitivity.  Written evaluations must be maintained confidentially in a
locked file in HR unit.

Section 5: Human Resources

January 2012, Page 5-25

CIHP Standard Operating Procedures

•  Employees  who  disagree  with  their  evaluation  may  express  their  comments  in
writing  in  the  space  provided  on  the  form  or,  if  they  desire,  in  a  separate
document.    These  comments  must  accompany  their  supervisor's  evaluation  of
them.

•  The  Senior  Human  Resources/Admin  Manager  is  available  to  provide  ongoing
support in the development and implementation of performance appraisal through
the provision of: appraisal forms; general training; customized presentations; and
individual  coaching  on  design  and  implementation,  as  well  as  support  the
completion of individual forms.

5.8.3  DISCIPLINARY MEASURES

Oral  Warning:  An oral warning is normally made by the immediate supervisor and/or
Chief Executive Officer.

Written Reprimand:  A written reprimand is made by the Chief Executive Officer.  This
is generally issued after an oral warning has been made with no subsequent improvement
in behavior, or when the severity of the misconduct warrants documentation.  A copy of
the  reprimand  must  be placed  in  the  employee’s  personnel file  and given  consideration
during the annual performance evaluation.

Disciplinary Hearing:  The office may choose to use disciplinary hearings as a measure
in responding to instances where an employee has allegedly committed an act or acts of
misconduct that may warrant suspension without pay or termination.

Suspension  without  Pay:    An  employee  may  be  suspended  without  pay  so  long  as  the
length of suspension is in accordance with labor law.  Legal counsel should be consulted
in  most  cases.    Suspension  can  be  administered  when  the  two  actions  above  have  not
been  successful,  or  when  the  gravity  of  the  offense  is  so  critical  for  continuation  of
employment  that  a  more  severe  corrective  measure  needs  to  be  taken.    A  disciplinary
infringement is considered to be serious when it is particularly intentional, cyclical, and
exposes CIHP to undue risk.

5.9  TERMINATION

To ensure that employees are not subjected to arbitrary or discriminatory practices in the
termination of their employment, all cases involving a layoff, release, or discharge must
be  discussed  with  the  appropriate  parties  prior  to  CIHP's  notification  to  the  employee.
Consultation should include the Chief Executive Officer and legal counsel.

CIHP expects high standards of behavior from its employees.  Employees that behave in
an  unacceptable  fashion  or  violate  CIHP  rules,  regulations,  or  policies  will  face
disciplinary sanctions proportional to the gravity of the offense they have committed.

Reduction in Work Force

At any time, funding may terminate or decrease to the extent that it dictates a reduction in
the size of  CIHP operation.  As a result, the office may have to reduce or terminate its
workforce.  CIHP will make every effort to inform staff as far in advance as possible of
the  possibility  or  contemplation  of  such  reduction  or  termination.    All  such  terminated
employees will be eligible for all benefits as determined by labor law.

5.10  PROBLEM RESOLUTION AND GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE

5.10.1

PROBLEM RESOLUTION

It is expected that if an employee has a work-related problem, he/she will discuss it first
with  his/her  supervisor.    If  such  a  discussion  is  not  possible  or  is  inappropriate,  he/she
should  discuss  it  with  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  or  Director  of  Management  Support
Services.

5.10.2

GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES

The objective of  the grievance procedure is to  resolve disputes  as  quickly  and  fairly  as
possible.  If an employee feels at any time that disciplinary action taken against him/her
is unfair, or he/she has any grievance against the office or CIHP in general, he/she may
invoke the grievance procedure as follows:

•  Any grievance must first be raised with the employee’s supervisor.  Every effort
must  be  made  by  both  parties  to  resolve  the  grievance.    If  no  satisfactory
settlement can be reached, the grievance will be referred to the Chief Executive
Officer for resolution.

•

If  a  grievance  is  raised  during  disciplinary  procedures,  notice  of  dismissal  may
not be given until the grievance is resolved.

The decision of the Chief Executive Officer on any formally reported issue is considered
final.

5.11  STAFF SAFETY AND SECURITY

5.11.1

RISKS TO STAFF SAFETY AND SECURITY

CIHP  employees  may  be  exposed  to  a  range  of  risks  in  their  daily  work.    These  risks
range from vehicle accidents to disease to personal attack.

Offices  must  take  precautionary  measures  according  to  the  risks  faced  in  each  State’s
working  environment.    Consideration  should  be  given  to  putting  in  place  security
procedures in the following risk areas:

•  Theft
•  Travel accidents
•  Health (mental and physical)
•  Civil unrest
•  Landmines and other unexploded ordinances

5.11.2

STAFF HIV/AIDS POLICY

The  organization  should  give  attention  to  the  accommodation  of  HIV/AIDS  and  other
debilitating  illnesses  in  the  workplace.  CIHP  aim  is  to  create  a  work  environment  in
which staff members feel comfortable, supported, and capable in addressing their needs.

With  respect  to  HIV/AIDS  in  the  workplace,  Offices  must  adhere  to  the  following
practices and procedures:

•  CIHP will not discriminate against those affected by HIV/AIDS.
•  CIHP guarantees that job access, promotion, security, termination, compensation,
and opportunities for training will not be influenced by an individual’s HIV-status.

•  CIHP will prohibit harassment of employees living with HIV/AIDS.
•  CIHP  will  protect  employees  living  with  HIV/AIDS  from  stigmatization  and

discrimination in the workplace.

•  CIHP will guard the confidentiality of all CIHP employees living with HIV/AIDS.
Under  no  circumstances  will  an  employee’s  health  status,  including  HIV-status,
be  revealed  to  a  third  party  without  the  employee’s  written  consent.    CIHP
employee  is  under  no  obligation  to  discuss  or  disclose  his/her  condition  to  the
organization or other CIHP employees.  However, to receive HIV/AIDS care and
treatment benefits, an employee may wish to inform the Director of Management
Support Services and New Business or other appointed person that he/she would
like to avail himself or herself of these benefits.  This information must be kept
confidential  and  will  be  disclosed  with  the  employee’s  written  consent  to
appropriate parties/organizations to enable access to the required care.

•  CIHP  does  not  require  HIV  testing  for  current  employees  or  job  applicants.
However,  CIHP  encourages  employees  to  seek  voluntary  HIV  counseling  and
testing for their own welfare and the welfare of their dependents.

Section 5: Human Resources

January 2012, Page 5-30

CIHP Standard Operating Procedures

CIHP  may  have  a  policy  regarding  specific  benefits  for  HIV-infected  employees  or
infected employee dependents.  One consideration for the organization is to ensure that
the benefits provided are chargeable to the grants/contracts funding office programs.

Sample
HIV/AIDS Benefits for HIV-Infected Employees or Infected Employee Dependents

CIHP will help facilitate access for employees living with HIV/AIDS and their dependents to the
National Care and Treatment Program. CIHP will cover the costs of antiretrovirals (ARVs) and
drugs for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections (OIs), including tuberculosis,
for persons living with HIV/AIDS and eligible dependents as per the national guidelines for
antiretroviral therapy and OI prophylaxis.  These costs will be covered by CIHP only in the event
that the employee/dependents are unable to access such treatment through the National Program
or via health insurance.  In addition to the costs of the medications, CIHP will cover costs of
CD4+ cell count monitoring at a maximum of three such tests per year.  In situations where the
employee’s health insurance supports costs of CD4+ cell count assays, CIHP will not cover such
costs.  The costs of the medications are not included in the otherwise established maximum limits
and will only be valid for the duration of the employee’s tenure as an CIHP employee.

5.11.3

RELOCATION AND EVACUATION

Occasionally, emergency situations arise where there is a significant threat to the welfare
of  CIHP  staff.    In  such  cases,  Chief  Executive  Officer  should  make  specific  plans  to
relocate threatened staff and accompanying dependents to a safer place within the State.
In the event that relocation or evacuation to another State is required, the Chief Executive
Officer should seek prior approval from local representatives of the funding agency(ies)
if at all possible without increasing the risk to staff lives.
When planning for relocation and evacuation, the office leadership should be sure to have
on  hand  what  those  departing  might  need,  e.g.,  information  on  evacuation  routes  and
emergency  contact  information.    In  addition,  the  organization  leadership  should  be
prepared  to  notify  others  of  the  decision  to  relocate  or  evacuate,  organize  payment  of
salaries, give clear instructions regarding roles and responsibilities, and establish a means
of continued communication between those evacuating and those staying behind.

5.12  HUMAN RESOURCES RECORDS

Maintaining complete and up-to-date human resources records is important for efficient
operations,  effective  human  resources  management,  documentation  in  the  case  of
grievances or legal cases, and meeting funding agencies’ record-keeping requirements.

Each  employee  shall  be  expected  to  provide  information  and  materials  upon  hire.    The
list of items may vary according to the job function, but will include:

•  A completed Contractor / Employee Biographical Data Sheet
