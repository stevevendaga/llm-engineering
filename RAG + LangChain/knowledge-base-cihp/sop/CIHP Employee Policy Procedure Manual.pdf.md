CIHP INTRODUCTION

The Center for Integrated Health Programs (CIHP) is a leading non-governmental, non-profit organization
that promotes better healthcare for all through the creation of strong and sustainable health systems. CIHP
will focus on clinical services, infrastructure, equipment/technology and human resources strengthening to
sustain  ICAP  achievements  and  successes
in  service  delivery,  monitoring,  evaluation,  and
training/education in Nigeria.

The  establishment  of  CIHP  became  necessary  due  to  current  global  orientation  towards  the  orderly
transition  of  funding  and  program  implementation  responsibilities  to  indigenous  organizations.  This  is
aimed  at  increasing  funding  effectiveness  and  strengthening/maturing  of  local  talent  for  the  adequate
provision of quality technical assistance for healthcare and development in Nigeria.
The transfer of responsibility for significant portions of the scope of work of the International Center for
AIDS Care and Treatment Programs (ICAP) to the Center for Integrated Health Programs (CIHP) is in line
with the United States government directive to implementing partners in Nigeria to build the capacity of
indigenous non-governmental organizations to become prime US Government contractors. CIHP currently
has its headquarters in Abuja and field offices in Nigeria.

1.  Vision

CIHP’s vision is to be an innovative leader transforming lives through partnerships for improved health
and development systems.

The organization brings together a team of committed individuals using their collective learning and
experiences, innovativeness and passion for excellence to deliver equitable, quality, cost effective and
integrated public health interventions through sustainable partnerships. The above  mission of CIHP
aligns with Nigeria’s goal of universal health care to reduce the morbidity and mortality rates due to
communicable diseases to the barest minimum; reverse the increasing prevalence of non-communicable
diseases; meet global targets on the elimination and eradication of diseases; and significantly increase
the life expectancy and quality of life of Nigerians.

2.  Core Values

CIHP’s  core  values  include  commitment,  innovative  leadership,  honesty  and  integrity,  and
partnerships. A few of the core objectives of CIHP include planning, implementation, and evaluation
of effective, evidence based prevention, care and treatment interventions for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis,
malaria and other related emerging chronic and contagious diseases; advising and /or complementing
the role of governments at federal, state and local levels on health policy issues, particularly access and
equity issues for low‐income and disadvantaged groups; and supporting any initiatives, programs or
activities that will build  an effective and integrated health system encompassing health care and the
underlying determinants of health, which is responsive to national and local priorities.

3.  Organizational Structure

CIHP’s  organizational  structure  is  designed  to  align  seamlessly  with  the  outlined  goals  and  core
functional areas and organizational units. These include Grants management; Financial Management
and Compliance; Management Support Services, Program Implementation, Program Support and State

Coordination  Units  in  addition  to  Strategic  Information  and  Research.  This  structure  enables  the
organization to be staffed by highly experienced professionals with significant expertise in each of the
functional  units.  As  a  leading  technical  assistance  organization  and  resource  center,  comprehensive
training and capacity building initiatives will be offered to individuals and organizations over time, as
a  source  of  income  generation  thanks  to  CIHP’s  ability  to  design  customized  capacity  building
programs in response to demands of potential client organizations in areas of core competence.

EMPLOYEE POLICY MANUAL PURPOSE

1.  The  purpose  of  the  CIHP  Employee  Policy  and  Procedure  Manual  is  to  state  the  rights  and
responsibilities  of  the  employer,  and  the  employee.  The  manual  also  contains  the  robust  listing  of
benefits offered by CIHP as part of their strategy to recruit and retain the highest quality workforce.
This document shall be the basic policy document to define the relationship between the employee and

acknowledgement  form  should  be  returned  to  the  Director,  Management  Support  Services  .This
compliance document shall be filed in individual Employee folders.

In certain instances where a specific written  policy or procedures guiding a particular scenario does not
exist  in  the  Standard  Operating  Procedures,  the  CIHP  Employee  Policy  &  Procedure  Manual  will  take
precedence.   The Employee Policy Manual held by the Director, Management Support Services will be the
controlling document should there be any disputes regarding different versions of the document that may
exist.

Center for Integrated Health Programs Nigeria shall hereinafter be referred to as CIHP.

Policy updates will be inserted into the manual on the recommendations of CIHP leadership as they occur
and are approved by the Chief Executive Officer. Any such changes will be distributed by email to all staff

Manual alters an employee’s status.  The Manual is a summary of our policies, which are presented here
only  as  a  matter  of  information.  While  we  hope  that  our  employment  relationship  will  be  mutually
rewarding, this Policy and Procedure Manual should not be construed and does not constitute a contract of

3.  Changes in Policy

This Policy and Procedure Manual supersedes all previous employee manuals and memos that may have
been issued from time to time on subjects covered in this Manual.

However, since our business and our organization are subject to change, we reserve the right to interpret,
change, suspend, cancel, or dispute with or without notice all or any part of our policies, procedures, and
benefits at any time.  We will notify all employees of these changes.  Changes will be effective on the dates
determined by CIHP, and after those dates all superseded policies will be null.

No individual supervisor, manager or director has the authority to change policies at any time.  If you are
uncertain about any policy or procedure, speak with your direct supervisor. Management reserves the right
to modify, alter or delete policies contained in this manual with due notice including, but not limited to,
policies on discipline or termination of employment.

following ruling authorities:

Laws of Nigeria

Manual and any other document.

5.  Equal Opportunity Employer

We rely upon the accuracy of information contained in the employment application and the accuracy of
other data presented throughout the hiring process and employment.  Any misrepresentations, falsifications,
or  material omissions  in any  of  this  information  or  data  may  result  in  exclusion  of  the  individual from
further consideration for employment or, if the person has been hired, termination of employment.

III.

EMPLOYMENT STATUS

1.  Full Time Employees

A full time employee works the standard 8 hour workday, Monday through Friday, with a  1 hour lunch
break for a total of 40 hours per week (resumption time is 8.00am and closing time is 5.00pm).  Employees
who,  for  personal  reasons,  must  adjust  the  time  of  their  workweek  may  do  so  at  the  discretion  of  the
Supervisor in consultation with and approval from the Chief Executive Officer. Full-time employees are
eligible for paid holiday, sick, and vacation time and the complete employee benefits package.

2.  Short Term Hires:

Short  Term  Hires  include  those  whose  performances  are  being  evaluated  to  determine  whether  further
employment  in  a  specific  position  or  with  the  company  is  appropriate,  or  individuals  who  are  hired  as
interim replacements to assist in the completion of a specific project or for vacation relief. Employment
beyond any initially stated period does not in any way imply a change in employment status. Short Term
Hires retain that status until they are notified of a change. They are not eligible for any of the company’s
benefit programs and are paid on the agreed daily rates for actual days worked.

Short term hires are usually engaged for a maximum period of 3 months and renewable once for another 3
months period, subject to performance as will be recommended by the supervisor in a performance appraisal
form, stating task and level of achievement within the first three (3) months period. Upon completion of 6
months, CIHP must determine if the gap being filled by the short term hire still exists. If it is determined
that the gap still exists, a fresh process is initiated to fill the gap. The previous candidate may be considered
to fill the short term position. Otherwise upon completion of 6 months, the contract terms and conditions
expire and the individual ceases to occupy such position.

CIHP can terminate the short term hire contract by giving two (2) working days notice to the employee or
payment for 2 days in lieu of notice.

3.  Volunteers

CIHP may engage volunteers from time to time to assist in project activities at the central and field office
levels.  At  the  discretion  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  and  with  funding  availability,  such  volunteers
maybe paid stipends to cover transportation and feeding costs while engaged with CIHP. Volunteers are
not eligible for any of CIHP’s benefit programs. Volunteers who wish to become employees of CIHP will
go through the normal recruitment process in order to be absorbed where vacancies become available.

No part of this publication may be reproduced, distributed, or transmitted in any form or by any means, including photocopying,
recording, or other electronic or mechanical methods, without the prior written permission of CIHP, except in the case of brief
quotations embodied in critical reviews and certain other non-commercial uses permitted by copyright law.

4.  Consultants

Consultants  may  be  hired  on  a  daily  basis  or  project  basis  for  a  specific  task  and  specific  duration.  A
Consultant  Agreement  Letter  (See  Appendix:  Consultant  Agreement  Letter)  must  be  approved  and
exchanged in advance, detailing the consultant’s scope of work and specifying the maximum number of
approved  days  and  daily  rate  of  pay.  Consultants  receive  no  additional  benefits  and  are  not  considered
employees of CIHP.

IV.   RECRUITMENT AND PROBATIONARY PROCESS

1.  Non-Discrimination

In  order  to  provide  equal  employment  and  advancement  opportunities  to  all  individuals,  employment
decisions  at  CIHP  will  be  based  on  merit,  qualifications,  and  abilities.    CIHP  does  not  discriminate  in
employment opportunities or practices because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age or disability.
CIHP is committed to an environment that is conducive to the advancement of opportunities for women.

CIHP will make reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with known disabilities as long as
essential job  functions  can  be  performed,  unless  doing  so  would  result  in  undue  hardship.   This  policy
governs  all  aspects  of  employment,  including  selection,  job  assignment,  compensation,  discipline,
termination, and access to benefits and training.

Employees with questions or concerns about discrimination in the workplace are encouraged to bring these
issues to the attention of their supervisor.  Employees can raise concerns and make reports without fear of
reprisal.  Anyone found to be engaging in unlawful discrimination will be subject to disciplinary action,
including termination of employment.

2.  Recruitment

As an equal opportunity employer, CIHP will normally advertise new or vacant positions in one or more
Nigerian  newspaper(s),  relevant  networks  and/or  through  appropriate  websites.  Application  for
employment is open to any qualified Nigerian citizen and permanent resident within the legal working ages
of  between  18  and  65  years.  Depending  on  the  position  and  special  circumstances,  other  recruitment
methods  may  be  utilized,  such  as  internal  job  postings  solely,  head  hunting,  public  announcements,
professional  Employee  recruitment  agents,  and  existing  databases  of  previous  applicants  or  previous
employees.

A  Job  Description  or  Position  Summary  shall  be  included  in  each  staff  member’s  Letter  of  Hire.  (See
Appendix: Sample Hire Letter). The Hire Letter will include the following:

-  Position title
-  Grant
-  Place of Employment

The  employee  will  effectively  carry  out  the  tasks  assigned  to  him/her  by  the  designated  supervisor  or
representatives  and  will  observe  all  regulations  governing  the  program.  Employees  should  note  that
functions and job responsibilities may change during the program life and CIHP has the right to make such
changes with little or no notice.

3.  New Employee Orientation

Orientation is a formal welcoming process that is designed to ensure the new employee  is informed about
the company, and prepared for their position.  New employee orientation is conducted by a representative
of the Human Resources unit, and includes an overview of CIHP history, an explanation of the company
core values, vision, and mission; and organizational goals and objectives.  In addition, the new employee
will be given an overview of benefits, tax, and legal issues, and complete any necessary paperwork.

Employees are presented with all codes, keys, and procedures needed to navigate within the workplace.
The Director of MSS or designee then introduces the new hire to staff throughout the company, reviews
their job description and scope of position, explains the company’s evaluation procedures, and helps the
new employee get started on specific functions.
Staff  Orientation  will  be  for  five  (5)  days.  Two  (2)  days  for  general  orientation  and  three  (3)  days  for
thematic unit orientation.

4.  Medical Examination

In  line  with  the  relevant  legal  requirements,  CIHP  ensures  that  all  employees  are  medically  fit  for
employment and that given their medical and personal histories; they will not be exposed to any health risk.
The medical examination is designed to determine an applicant’s ability to perform his/her job functions
and identify any condition/s that may prevent or hinder the applicant from effectively carrying out his/her
duties or which may place the individual, colleagues or others at risk.

Once  a  provisional  offer  has  been  made  to  an  applicant  and  the  applicant  accepts  the  offer,  a  medical
examination would be conducted at CIHP’s expense by a health professional also of CIHP’s choice.  Some
health conditions may result in the candidate being deemed unfit to undertake a position with CIHP due to
potential health risks associated with the position.

Drivers are required to have full medical examination which will include optical tests, and submit a medical
certificate of fitness. This too would be conducted at CIHP’s expense.
The expenses connected to the medical examination may be covered with the Health Insurance provided
by the organisation.

Medical examination shall be required of all new employees. Issuance of a medical certificate of fitness for
employment shall be a condition precedent for confirmation of employment.

5.  Probationary Period

The probationary period for regular full-time and regular part-time employees lasts up to 90 days from date
of hire.  During this time, employees have the opportunity to evaluate our organization as a place to work
and management has its first opportunity to evaluate the employee.  During this introductory period, both
the employee and the organization have the right to terminate employment with two weeks advance notice.
Upon  satisfactory  completion  of  the  probationary  period,  a  90-day  review  will  be  carried  out.    All
employees, regardless of classification or length of service, are expected to meet and maintain standards
for job performance and behavior.

The probationary period is intended to give new employees the opportunity to demonstrate their ability to
achieve  a  satisfactory  level  of  performance  and  to  determine  whether  the  new  position  meets  their
expectations.

CIHP  will  also  use  this  time  to  evaluate  employee  capabilities,  work  habits,  behavior  and  overall
performance.  Verification of professional certificates will also be conducted upon interim confirmation.

Newly hired staff are considered probationary until the completion of 90 (ninety) days of employment.
Start date for probation is the employee’s hire date. Either party may terminate employment anytime during
the probationary period by giving two weeks’ notice or payment in lieu of notice.

While an employee is on probation, she/he will be evaluated on an ongoing basis. It is important for line
managers to provide regular feedback to new employees during this probation period through discussions
on job tasks, identification of employee strengths and weakness and suggestions on purposeful approaches
for meeting performance targets and objectives.  The supervisor or line manager is advised to hold a formal
performance review meeting with the new staff after the initial six weeks of employment. At the end of 90
days  period,  a  formal  evaluation  will  be  conducted  and  a  decision  made  on  whether  to  confirm  the
employment contract, extend the probation or terminate the employment contract. Where the employee’s
performance during the probation period is not satisfactory, the probation period may be extended at the
discretion of the Chief Executive Officer subject to a maximum three months extension beyond the initial
90 days. Any extension of probation must be in writing and the reasons for extension documented.

If at the end of the extension period his/ her performance is still not up to the required standard CIHP may
terminate his/her employment with 2 weeks written notice.

The end of the probationary period will be signified by a satisfactorily completed performance evaluation
and a formal letter of interim confirmation issued to the staff. Final confirmation will only be given to new
hires following verification of academic and professional credentials.

Confirmation of an employee will be signed by the Chief Executive Officer or delegated authority.

V.

OFFICE AND WORK SCHEDULE

1.  Place of Employment

The place of employment shall be the CIHP Central Office in Abuja or any of the other office locations in
Nigeria.      The  specific  location  of  employment  shall  be  as  stipulated  in  the  employment  offer  letter.
However,  staff  may  be  reassigned  to  another  place  of  employment  in  order  to  meet  changing  CIHP
requirements.

2.  Transfers between CIHP offices

Depending  on  the  operational  requirements  of  CIHP,  the  employer  may  exercise  the  discretion  of
transferring  any  staff  from  one  office  location  to  another.  Notification  of  such  transfers  will  be
communicated  to  the  staff  through  a  written  correspondence  signed  by  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  or
his/her designate. The consent of the employee would be sought and agreements reached before the transfer
is effected.

In the case where a staff has been transferred, CIHP will be responsible for the following:

  Two weeks (14 days) stay in a hotel designated by CIHP in the new location. There shall be no

payment in lieu of stay in the hotel.

  Two weeks (14 days) M&I  E computed based on the applicable rate for the new location
  The staff will be provided with a lump sum re-imbursement of expenses incurred to move personal
effects to the new location not exceeding N50, 000. The actual sum to be paid will be computed
based on the prevailing CIHP mileage rates and family size, duly approved by the CEO and subject
to availability of funds

The hotel stay may also be extended on a needs basis to newly employed staff at the discretion of the Chief
Executive Officer.

3.  Working Hours and Lunch Time

Except  where  otherwise  specified,  official  working  hours  of  operation  are  from  8:00  am  to  5:00  pm,
Monday through Friday, with a one-hour lunch break each day, except on holidays. Support staff, such as
Secretary/Receptionist, Office Assistant , Driver and any other employees as identified as being needful for
CIHP operations  may be asked to modify their starting and ending work times or the timing/duration of
their lunch break to accommodate the needs of the office.

Standard working hours for drivers is also 40 hours a week, Mondays through Fridays. However they may
be required to work extra hours as the occasion demands and paid overtime at the discretion of the Chief
Executive Officer. Prior approval must be sought and obtained from the CEO or designee before carrying

Employees are allowed a one-hour lunch break.  Lunch breaks generally are taken between the hours of 11
a.m. and 2:00 p.m. on a staggered schedule so that employee absence does not create a challenge for co-
workers or clients.

4.  Attendance & Tardiness

Regular, punctual attendance is essential for effective performance by both the employee and members of
his/her team. Employees are expected to report to work on time and to return from lunch break promptly.
An  attendance  register  to  record  times  of  reporting  and  leaving  work  by  all  staff  is  in  place  to  assist
Management in assuring good attendance and team performance. Employees are required to maintain their
personal time sheet (See Appendix: Employee Time Sheet) on a daily basis. The timesheet must be signed
by the employee and approved by his or her supervisor at the end of each pay period.

Supervisors are responsible for monitoring the punctuality and attendance of all employees during working
hours.    Supervisors  should  ensure  that  the  attendance  and  absence  policy  is  applied  consistently  and
attendance-related disciplinary actions documented clearly, carefully, and promptly.  Attendance problems
should be reflected in employee performance evaluations.

There may be occasions, however, when emergencies or other circumstances prevent an employee from
reporting to work as scheduled.  In such cases, the employee is expected to call his or her supervisor ahead
of the reporting time to inform the supervisor of the situation no later than 9.30am if the anticipated delay
will prevent the employee from resuming at work in the morning.  Any Employee who  absents him/herself
from work and fails to contact his/her supervisor, or their next level supervisor or the Director, Management
Support  Services,    shall  be  assumed    to  have  absented  him/herself  from  work  without  permission  and
appropriate disciplinary actions will be initiated. Where absence is as result of medical conditions involving
the staff or his/her spouse/immediate family members , a record of their absence will be documented and
the days taken from their sick leave .Where the staff has used up their available sick time for the year, the
days  of  absence  shall  be  deducted  from  their annual leave.  Upon  resumption, the  affected  staff  will  be
expected to complete the leave application form.
Absences due to ill health for more than 48 hours must be supported by a medical certificate issued by a
government certified medical practitioner. Where the staff is absent from work without permission or cause
for three consecutive days, he/she shall be considered to have abandoned his/ her position, and progressive
disciplinary actions will commence. It is the responsibility of the supervisor to report any absence from
duty to the Director, Management Support Services immediately. Salary and allowances will not be paid
for the period of absence without permission.

Whenever possible, staff members who are absent should make arrangements to have any critical work
assignments covered by someone else, or let the supervisor know what critical tasks are pending and what
must be done in their absence.

5.  Overtime Policy Statement

CIHP does not expect, require, or encourage any of its employees to work overtime. However, under certain
circumstances during times of heavy program activity, the staff may need to remain after hours or come in
on weekends to complete an assignment with no additional remuneration. CIHP does not pay any overtime
unless exceptionally approved by the Chief Executive Officer.

Drivers,  Cleaners,  Stores  Assistants  and  Office  Assistants  who  are  required  to  work  over  any
weekend  would  be  entitled  to  a  transport  allowance.  This  would  require  prior  authorization  of  the  line
manager and duly approved by the CEO or Designee and subject to the availability of fund

6.  Unscheduled Office Closing

The Chief Executive Officer may officially delay opening, close early, or close the office for the entire day
due  to  unplanned  events  or  circumstances  that  would  prevent  employees  from  safely  or  effectively  or
appropriately performing their duties (e.g., inclement weather, sustained power failure, fire, political unrest,
national mourning, force majeure etc.) When an office officially closes, employees who were scheduled to
work  should  use  code  “X”  on  their  timesheets  to  account  for  hours  not  worked.  Normal  remuneration
applies in such instances.

The Chief Executive Officer will inform the funders when unplanned circumstances merit office closure
for longer than four hours.

VI.  WORKPLACE HIV/AIDS POLICY

1.  All CIHP staff are subject to CIHP’s Staff HIV Policy, which prohibits discrimination against those
affected by HIV/AIDS and supports the Greater Involvement of People Living with HIV/AIDS
(GIPA)  principle.  The  CIHP  work  place  HIV/AIDS  policy  has  the  following  eight  primary
components:

  Non-discrimination statement
  No mandatory HIV testing
  No denial of employment based on known or assumed HIV status
  Reasonable accommodation such as time-off for hospital appointments and drug refills
  Safe work environment/universal precautions
  Medical confidentiality
  No job termination if fit to work
  Same opportunities/benefit as other employees
  Facilitation of access to government HIV care and treatment programs

2.  CIHP  does  not  discriminate  against  any  qualified individual  on the basis of  known  or  assumed
HIV/AIDS  status.  Non-discrimination  applies  to  job  applications,  hiring,  advancement,
termination, compensation, or training.

Furthermore, CIHP will treat HIV infection and AIDS the same as other illnesses in terms of all of
our  employee  policies  and  benefits,  including  health  and  life  insurance,  disability  benefits  and
leaves of absence.

3.  Anti  –retroviral  Drugs:  CIHP  will  help  facilitate  enrollment  for  the  HIV  infected  employee  or

VII.

SALARY COMPENSATION AND INCREASES

1.  Salary Rates

CIHP policy is to compensate staff in line with the CIHP Remuneration Policy.
The Remuneration Policy is updated at the discretion of the Board of Trustees/ Board of Directors, and any
changes  in  salary,  allowances  or  benefits  are  to  be  made  by  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  based  on  this
remuneration policy and subject to budget availability.
All  salaries  and  employee  contracts  are  stated  and  paid  in  Nigeria  Naira  (NGN)  with  exceptions  for
expatriate staff where applicable.  Fluctuations in the foreign exchange rates have no bearing on salary rates
paid to CIHP local hire employees.

2.  Annual Performance Appraisal and Increase

For all regular full time employees of CIHP, their performance will be evaluated according to an ongoing
12-month  cycle  tied  to  each  fiscal  year  using  the  CIHP  performance  evaluation  forms.  The  completed
performance evaluation form must be signed both by the supervisor/line manager and the individual being
appraised with a copy retained by the supervisor/line manager and the employee, and a copy sent to the
Human Resources unit to be retained in the employee folder.

Annual merit increases will be awarded to eligible staff (based on availability of funds), depending on the
result  of  the  performance  appraisals  process  which  will  be  in  line  with  the  performance  management
guidelines approved by CIHP leadership from time to time. Only staff who have spent a minimum of six
months within the performance appraisal cycle are eligible to receive a merit increase for that year. Each
employee’s annual salary  may be reviewed at least once each year based on availability of funds.  The
employee’s review date will usually be conducted on or about the anniversary date of employment or the
date of the previous compensation review.  Such reviews may be conducted more frequently for a newly
created position, or based on a recent promotion. Increases will be determined on the basis of performance,
adherence to company policies and procedures, and ability to meet or exceed duties per job description and
achieve performance goals. In relation to the above, Transport Logistic Assistants who are involved in any
car incident or accident within a calendar year shall not be entitled to a performance increase within that
year. The purpose and intent of this provision is to encourage the use of defensive driving techniques with
the Transport Logistics Team and justify CIHP investment in Defensive Driving trainings and practices in
accordance with Section 13 of the CIHP Vehicle Use & Maintenance Policy.

Any employee who is awarded an overall performance rating of “Did not meet expectations” will have a 3
month Performance Improvement plan drawn up for them by the position  supervisor in consultation with
Human Resources . This plan will be discussed thoroughly with the employee.   At the expiration of the
performance improvement plan period and depending on the improvements observed in the 3-month period,
a report will be made on the employee’s continued employment with CIHP according to the provisions of
Section  XIV  of  this  manual.  Continued  inability  to  meet  job  expectations  beyond  the  performance
improvement plan period will result in termination of employment.

3.  Promotion

Owing to the reality that CIHP mainly implements donor funded projects with fixed time duration, there
are limited opportunities for promotion within CIHP. However, all positions in the organization will be

filled by advertisement and interview. Qualified internal candidates will be  encouraged to participate in
such interviews.

4.  Reclassification/Restructuring

Reclassification/Restructuring of positions can occur when a different skill set is needed due to a significant
change  in job  responsibilities.  In  the  case  of additional skills  needed,  CIHP  will  attempt  to  provide the
employee with training and assistance to obtain the necessary skills needed. In the event that the current
employee is unable to cope with the additional job responsibilities, or does not have the required skill set
for the position, the staff member  may be offered another position if available, or   his/her  appointment
terminated  if  there  are  no  improvements  after  the  mandatory  three  months  performance  improvement
period.

5.  Salary Advances

Personal salary advances to employees are prohibited by CIHP policy. Employees will not receive advance
payments against future salaries. In the rare case that the office feels an exception is warranted, this requires
the explicit approval of the Chief Executive Officer.

Salary advances are neither a “benefit” nor a "right" of employment; it is for truly exceptional emergency
purposes and may not exceed ten per cent (10%) of the employee’s annual basic salary.  The advance must
be  cleared  within  six  months  of  issuance  or  by  termination  of  employment,  whichever  is  soonest.  The
procedures for this exception are available in the CIHP Standard Operation Procedures (SOP) document.

VIII.   TIME SHEETS AND PAY PERIOD

Each employee must maintain an accurate, up-to-date timesheet on a daily basis. Each employee should
submit a completed monthly timesheet to the Chief Executive Officer or designate who must countersign
to indicate review and approval.  Traveling staff should complete their timesheet prior to departure.  A
completed and signed timesheet must be submitted to support corresponding salary payments for that pay
period.  The time sheet cycle runs from the 21st day of the preceding month to the 20th day of the current
month. (See Appendix: Employee Timesheet).
Time sheets must be submitted by the 23rd of every month, or the next working day if the 23rd is a weekend
or holiday.
Salaries will be paid monthly, on the 25th day of each month.  In December, salaries may be paid by the 18th
of December.

IX.

TAXES

In accordance with Nigerian Tax Laws, each staff member is responsible for payment of Nigerian taxes.
The Director of Finance & Sub-contracts will ensure that appropriate Pay As You Earn (PAYE) taxes are
deducted  at  source  and  calculated  based  on  the  applicable  tax  rates  in  the  state  where  the  employee  is
located, and paid to the relevant tax authority on a monthly basis. CIHP reserves the right to deduct from
source all penalties, costs and damages, suffered as a result of staff providing wrong information or wrong
application of tax laws. Tax deducted shall be remitted to the appropriate tax authority by 10th day of the
month following the deduction.

requirements  of  Local  Nigerian  law  and  consistent  with  provisions outlined in  the  CIHP  Remuneration
policy.

The  frequency  of  payments  of  these  allowances  (monthly,  quarterly,  annual  etc)  will  be  based  on  fair
consideration of employee needs, applicable tax legislation and availability of funds.

1.  Home Ownership Grant

In line with the National Housing Policy of the Federal Government of Nigeria on the provision of decent
and affordable housing for all Nigerians, CIHP  has instituted an employer-assisted housing  initiative to
encourage all eligible staff members towards owning their own home. CIHP will pay an upfront lump sum
to all staff to facilitate this. The payment will be made at the beginning of every program year in October.
Eligible staff are all full time employees who have been confirmed and are not undergoing any disciplinary
investigation as at the date of eligibility being October 1. The amount payable to staff is determined by the
staff members’ designation and/ or salary band. Employees who work in the Central Office Abuja will be
paid a slightly higher sum to make up for the higher  property costs in the FCT.

In the event that an employee disengages from his/her employment with CIHP in the course of a program
year, he/she will pay back the unearned portion of the upfront payment made to him/her.  Employee will
sign an undertaking to refund any unearned portion of the grant before their last day of employment with
CIHP in the event of disengagement.

For international hires, provision of accommodation with basic functional furnishings will be provided in

be prorated.  Only confirmed staff members that have spent minimum of one year as at November 30, and
are still in employment at the time of payment are qualified for 13th month payment. This is an incentive
for retention and loyalty to the organization.

7.  Acting Allowance

The Chief Executive Officer reserves the right to approve a staff for acting appointment due to program
exigencies pending the completion of recruitment process to fill such position. Any staff that is required to
act in higher position shall be entitled to acting allowance. This will be computed based on a maximum
10%  of  basic  salary  of  such  employee.  In  order  to  qualify  for  acting  allowance,  the  acting  period/
assignment must be at least four weeks.

8.  Health Insurance Cover

Nigerian labor law obligates CIHP to provide comprehensive health care for their employees. Therefore,
all  full  time  employees  are  entitled  to  medical  insurance  benefits  for  themselves  and  their  dependents
(current spouse and four biological or legally adopted economically dependent, unmarried children under
the age of 21) consistent with the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) guidelines.

All staff are required to take a medical insurance cover from a Health Management Organization (HMO)
of their choice and the premium paid will be deducted from the allowable maximum annual medical benefit
of N500, 000.00. Any balance after deducting this premium will be used to offset any medical expenses not
covered by such a policy.

Balance of the medical benefit after deducting the medical insurance premium will be available to staff and
used to meet the medical expenses excluded from, or that are not covered by the Health Insurance cover.
This will also include expenses that promote fitness and health of staff. CIHP shall provide first aid and
emergency response supplies for the central and state offices’ staff at all time. Supplies include basic life
support items that can improve or reverse negative prognosis of life threatening events that may occur while
staff are in the office before evacuation to medical facility.

9.  Hazard Allowance:

In  the  course  of  program  implementation,  CIHP  Staff  may  be  exposed  to  several  hazardous  and  risky
circumstances especially in remote communities in the states that CIHP programs are implemented. Cases of
security risk issues across the country such as kidnapping, insurgencies and herdsmen activities are common
occurrences in Nigeria. This hazard allowance is to serve as an additional incentive to staff members to mitigate
these peculiar risks staff are exposed to in the course of duties and can buy additional insurance. CIHP shall pay
its staff a Hazard allowance which will be a range from 20% to 25% of the annual basic salary of staff subject to
funds availability annually.  This allowance is payable to staff who are on board as at 30th of June of every year.

In view of inflationary trends in the country and its attendant effects on costs of living, CIHP will pay an annual
Cost of Living Salary Allowance (COLA) to mitigate the effects of the inflation on staff. Fixing the rate to be
applied in any given year will be guided by data on Consumer Price Index published by the National Bureau of
Statistics. The approved rate to be paid should not exceed 25% of Annual basic salary, and it will be paid annually
in April. The COLA will be prorated for staff who are employed in the course of the year. Payment of COLA is
subject to availability of funds.

sum  equivalent  to  1%  of  each  employee’s  total  emolument  to  the  Nigeria  Social  Insurance  Trust  Fund  in
accordance with the statutory stipulations of the Employees’ Compensation Act 2010. This provision is a social
insurance that specifically covers injuries, disabilities and death arising as a result of, and in the course of duty.
All cases of injury or disabling occupational diseases within the scope of the Act must be reported immediately
to CIHP and ultimately to the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund Management Board within 14 days of the
occurrence.  The NSITF Management Board has the responsibility for processing and implementation of claims
under the Act.

for the duration of the project and mitigate challenges associated with attrition of key staff. This is considered
exceptional best practice in the development sector in Nigeria.
This benefit is not a Severance pay and eligibility is not determined by Redundancy.
Payment of end of service benefit is therefore contingent upon provision and approval of this benefit in the budget
for the year by the funders. Where end of service benefit is not approved by the funders in a particular program
year, or discontinued after previous years of payment CIHP will not pay the benefit for that year or for subsequent
years.
An employee, whose employment is terminated, either voluntarily or involuntarily, is eligible for End of Service

Sick  /medical  leave  can  be  used  for  an  employee's  personal  illness  or  to  care  for  an  immediate  family
member (child, spouse, or parent). It is also intended to provide time off with pay when an illness or an
accident outside of work makes it medically unadvisable for the employee to work and to provide for a
temporary period of recuperation.   Employees may not take more than twelve paid sick days in any given
year. If the employee requires additional sick leave, he/she should use accrued annual vacation days.

Crèche Facility for Nursing Mothers

In support of nursing mothers, CIHP has established a functional crèche which is available to all nursing
mothers including those who have recently returned to work after the expiration of their maternity leave.
The  crèche-at-work  facility  is  designed  to  increase  productivity  and  reduce  absenteeism  as  well  as
strengthen the bonds between parent and child if they can spend more time together than would normally
be the case. It is expected that nursing mothers will be able to spend lunch hours with their babies and
provide them with peace of mind knowing that their infants are nearby. Staff are encouraged to utilize this
service responsibly.

7.  Paternity Leave

Employees with more than 12 months continuous service with CIHP are entitled to five days paid Paternity
Leave.  For  staff  to  be  able  to  access  this  benefit,  they  will  be  required  to  present  a  medical  certificate
indicating the Expected Date of Delivery (EDD) at least 2 months prior to the actual delivery date.   The
leave can be taken anytime within six months after the birth of the baby.

Paternity leave can only be taken by a staff once within a two year period and must be in relation to a duly
registered spouse as contained in the Employee Personal Information Form.

XII.  CODE OF CONDUCT

1.  Confidentiality

During the course of employment, an employee may have access to confidential or proprietary information.
Examples  of  this type  of  information  may  include  financial  data,  patient info/data,  computer  programs,
proposals, documents, procedures, staff information, and information in a formative stage.
This  information  may  be  the  property  of  CIHP  or  a  client,  e.g.,  CDC/USG  Embassy/other  donors.
Employees are prohibited from sharing and/ disclosing such information to outside parties. Wherever any
employee  is  unclear  about  the  sensitivity  of  the  information  being  sought  by  outside  parties,  such  an
employee is required to seek appropriate guidance from the Chief Executive Officer.

2.  Legal Indemnity

CIHP shall accept no liability for claims by third parties in respect of liabilities suffered as a result of an
act which constitutes a breach/infringements of the rights of the said third party by an employee of CIHP,
where such an act was performed in his personal/domestic capacity or performed negligently or in excess
of express instructions given by his Supervisor or anyone with the capacity to so give, while in CIHP's
employment.

3.  Conflict of Interest
CIHP respects the rights of its employees relative to activities outside this employment which are private
and which do not conflict with or reflect adversely upon CIHP. Similarly, employees are asked to refrain
from any activity that would negatively influence CIHP or its ability to do business in Nigeria or elsewhere.

CIHP  staff  are  expected  to  promote  CIHP’s  interests  and  to  refrain  from  using  their  position  in  the
organization to supplement their incomes directly or indirectly, or to obtain other material benefits including
gifts.

No part of this publication may be reproduced, distributed, or transmitted in any form or by any means, including photocopying,
recording, or other electronic or mechanical methods, without the prior written permission of CIHP, except in the case of brief
quotations embodied in critical reviews and certain other non-commercial uses permitted by copyright law.

Employee Policy and Procedure Manual, Revised March, 2016

25

An employee of CIHP may perform work or services for other organizations only to the extent that the
activity does not prevent the employee from devoting the time and effort to  CIHP business that her/his
position requires, and such work takes place outside business hours.

CIHP staff may not, directly or indirectly, be financially engaged or involved in any enterprise or program
to which CIHP is providing assistance; or an activity being performed with funding from the USG and its
entities.

No staff member should knowingly act in a capacity, or urge the organization to act in a manner designed
to confer any financial or commercial benefit, whether actual or potential, on her or himself (including
family  members),  or  on  any  firm  or  corporation  in  which  s/he  has  a  significant  interest  as  partner,
stockholder, director or officer.  CIHP, as a general rule, does not enter into purchasing contracts with staff
or members of their immediate families.  An acquisition from a business in which a CIHP employee has an
interest is prohibited unless full disclosure of the background facts are presented in writing to the Chief
Executive Officer and approved.  Interest is deemed present if the CIHP employee and/or his or her spouse
or partner or children own ten percent (10%) or more of the assets of a business.  No CIHP employee,
officer,  or  agent  shall  participate  in  the  selection,  award,  or  administration  of  a  purchasing  contract
supported by U.S. government/donor funds if such participation would involve a real or apparent conflict
of interest.

Information obtained because of employment at CIHP that is not generally available to the public should
not be communicated to any individual(s) or organization(s) outside CIHP. The organization reserves the
exclusive right to determine what information can or cannot be communicated outside the organization.
Whereas local employees are free to participate in the political process of their country, they may not under
any circumstances link CIHP or its organizational relation to their political activities unless stated otherwise
by the organization. Foreign employees are forbidden to interfere in the internal political affairs of Nigeria.

CIHP strives to be in strict compliance with all laws and regulations that are applicable to its activities. In
the  event  that  a  regulation  is  ambiguous  or  difficult  to  interpret,  CIHP  has  access  to  legal  counsel  to
determine compliance with a policy and observance of all laws and regulations. Such advice shall be sought
if any questions arise.

4.  Prostitution and Related Activities

CIHP is opposed to prostitution and related activities, which are inherently harmful and dehumanizing, and
contribute to the phenomenon of trafficking in persons. Accordingly, CIHP staff shall not advocate the
legalization or practice of prostitution or sex trafficking. This does not preclude the provision to individuals
of palliative care, treatment, or post-exposure pharmaceutical prophylaxis and necessary pharmaceuticals
and commodities, including test kits and condoms. For the purposes of this clause, “Sex trafficking means
the  recruitment,  harboring,  transportation,  provision,  or  obtaining  of  a  person  for  the  purpose  of  a
commercial sex act”. Consequently all CIHP sub-recipients that receive US Government funds must certify
compliance with this provision prior to actual receipt of funds.

5.  Anti-Terrorism

CIHP  is  opposed  to  all  acts  of  terrorism.  Accordingly,  CIHP  staff  shall  not  be  involved  in  any  acts  of
terrorism or support any terrorism related activity or organization. CIHP will also ensure that none of its

grant funds are used directly or indirectly to assist in, sponsor, or provide support for acts of terrorism or to
support organizations or persons listed as terrorists on publicly available lists maintained by its donors and
the Federal Government of Nigeria, and other entities. To assist CIHP in complying with applicable law,
all staff and sub-grantees agree to provide such information as CIHP may reasonably request, including
information  about  persons  or  organizations  that  will  or  have  received  funds  in  connection  with  its  sub
grants.

CIHP may also check the names of the principal officers and directors of potential grantees, and depending
on the circumstances, others who may receive funds from, or are integral to, its grants. This clause provides
a description of CIHP’s process to ensure it meets its legal requirements in this area while respecting rights
of grantees.

6.  Political Activity

Whereas  CIHP  employees  are  free  to  participate  in  political  processes,  they  may  not  under  any
circumstances link CIHP to their political activities in any form.  Expatriate/non-Nigerian employees are
forbidden to interfere in the internal political affairs of Nigeria.

7.  Substance Free Workplace

CIHP operates a substance-free workplace in all CIHP locations.  The use of Tobacco and tobacco-related
products and illicit use of narcotics, banned substances, or controlled drugs in any form is prohibited in all
CIHP-owned,  leased,  or  controlled  facilities  and  vehicles.    This  includes  all  offices,  laboratories,  and
storage rooms.  Employees who smoke must do so outside of CIHP facilities.

Alcohol, banned substances and all other substances of abuse will not be consumed during work hours.  No
employee will work under the influence of alcohol, banned substances and other substances of abuse on
CIHP  premises  or  while  operating  a  CIHP  vehicle,  no  matter  where  the  substances  are  consumed.    An
employee found to be under the influence of alcohol or any of these substances during working hours is
subject to immediate termination of employment.

The possession, use, manufacture, sale, or distribution of illegal drugs and banned substances is strictly
forbidden and grounds for immediate dismissal.

Employees should not operate a CIHP vehicle while under the influence of any legal drug that may cause
drowsiness or other side effects that may be dangerous under certain circumstances.

8.  Harassment

Employees shall have the right to the enjoyment of a workplace that is free from all forms of harassment
by word of mouth or conduct resulting in fear, pressure, or discomfort caused by any other fellow employee.
Employees who engage in any form of harassment and bodily harm of other employees shall be in breach
of this agreement and shall be liable to disciplinary action or immediate dismissal.

9.  Workplace Violence

No part of this publication may be reproduced, distributed, or transmitted in any form or by any means, including photocopying,
recording, or other electronic or mechanical methods, without the prior written permission of CIHP, except in the case of brief
quotations embodied in critical reviews and certain other non-commercial uses permitted by copyright law.

Employee Policy and Procedure Manual, Revised March, 2016

27

CIHP  does  not  tolerate  any  acts  or  threats  of  violence  committed  by  or  against  employees.  CIHP  will
discipline or terminate any employee found to have violated this policy.

Any  employee  carrying  firearms  or  other  weapons,  concealed  or  otherwise,  in  Program  offices  will  be
subject to immediate disciplinary action up to and including termination.

10.  Nepotism

Relatives of employees are generally considered for employment based on their qualifications. However,
where  the  employment  of  a  worker’s  family  member  results  in  the  types  of  prohibited  employment
relationships identified below, CIHP will not consider or accept applications for employment.

Hiring of family members is prohibited if employment results in the creation of:
- A supervisory/subordinate relationship between family members. If a direct supervisory or managerial
relationship would be established, family members of a current employee cannot be considered for an open
position.

- An actual conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest. Generally, this bars employment
of an employee’s family member who has an auditing or control relationship to the employee’s job.

Employees are responsible for full disclosure of any such relationships at the time of hire. Failure to disclose
such relationships will constitute grounds for disciplinary actions including termination.

Employees who marry or establish a close personal relationship (with an imminent view to marry) cannot
continue  in  their  current  positions.  If  the  situations  specified  above  does  occur,  the  employees  will  be
permitted to determine which one of them will resign within a specified period not exceeding 3 months. If
neither  party  resigns  CIHP  reserves  the  right  to  terminate  the  employment  of  both  for  operational
requirements.

11.  Official Communications

While the importance of official communication in an organization like CIHP cannot be over emphasized,
Staff  must  follow  proper  channel  of  communication to  ensure  orderliness,  harmonious  relationship  and
improved productivity in the organization.  This is imperative for effective social interaction, sharing of
ideas  and  experience  and  fostering  of  good  relationship  that  promotes  self-fulfillment  and  outstanding
performance in the workplace.  To this end, the following channel and method of official communication
shall be observed in the organization:

All  applications  or  request  for  the  Chief  Executive  Officer’s  approval  shall  pass  through  the  staff’s
Supervisor  who  will  comment  on  such  applications  or  request  before  forwarding  same  through  the
appropriate designate authority.

Official mail or Letter by any employee to another employee or Department within the organization must
first be discussed by the employees’ Supervisor who must also be copied when the mail or Letter is finally
sent to the recipient. This is to ensure that necessary inputs have been made to the final mail or Letter and
that all the relevant stakeholders are aware of the contents and subject of the mail.

No part of this publication may be reproduced, distributed, or transmitted in any form or by any means, including photocopying,
recording, or other electronic or mechanical methods, without the prior written permission of CIHP, except in the case of brief
quotations embodied in critical reviews and certain other non-commercial uses permitted by copyright law.

Employee Policy and Procedure Manual, Revised March, 2016

28

No employee shall address the press on behalf of CIHP or on matters relating to CIHP without approval
from the Chief Executive Officer or designate authority.

No employee will provide a professional reference on behalf of  CIHP in respect of a present or former
employee of CIHP without the authorization of the Chief Executive Officer.

Any employee who fails to comply with the above channel of communication shall be regarded to have
breached the approved channel of communication and this shall attract disciplinary action.

12.  Dress Code

Because of the highly visible and public nature of CIHP’s work, employees are encouraged to maintain a
neat, clean and professional appearance and should give careful consideration to conforming to the
standards of business attire most common to the location of their job and site assignment. In deciding
appropriate dressing, employees are expected to give attention to choice of colors (mild colors
preferably), personal safety and moderation/modesty.

As a general reference, the following are considered inappropriate attire for the office
Jeans trousers (except on Fridays or while travelling to field locations)


  Plastic flip flops
  Torn clothing
  Sweat pants/track suits
  Shorts
  Tank or halter tops
  Clothes with high slits
  Tight fitting or “body hugging” clothes
  Clothing that exposes waist line, arms /shoulders or undergarments

Where uniforms or ID cards are provided, employees shall always wear them in the required form.
The uniforms shall be replaced as deemed fit by the Management or when necessary as a result of fair wear-
and-tear.  Any  staff  that  loses  his/her  uniform  may  be  surcharged.  An  employee  who  is  issued  a  CIHP
uniform  will  be  required  to  hand  over  the  uniform  in  a  clean  and  good  condition  to  the  Director,
Management Support Services before final disengagement.

13.  Gifts, Gratuities and Business Courtesies

CIHP is committed to operating solely on a merit basis. Staff should avoid any actions that create a
perception  that  favourable  treatment  of  outside  entities  by  CIHP  was  sought,  received  or  given  in
exchange  for  personal  business  courtesies.  Business  courtesies  include  gifts,  gratuities,  meals,
refreshments, entertainment or other benefits from persons or companies with whom CIHP does or may
do  business.    CIHP  staff  must  neither  give  nor  accept  business  courtesies  that  constitute,  or  could
reasonably  be  perceived  as  constituting,  unfair  business  inducements  that  would  violate  the  law,
regulation or polices of CIHP or any of its donor organisations, or would cause embarrassment or reflect
negatively on CIHP’s reputation. Such gifts or sources may be from vendors, contractors, suppliers,
health facilities, community based organisations prospective employees, or clients.

No part of this publication may be reproduced, distributed, or transmitted in any form or by any means, including photocopying,

Examples of Prohibited Gifts:

• Any item that is more than $50 in value

• Multiple, recurring items that might individually be allowed. For example, if a CIHP employee is working
with  a  contractor/sub-recipient  on  site  for  a  period  of  time,  and  he/she  is  provided  with  meals  and
refreshments throughout his/her stay. Though each meal may be less than $50, the recurring nature of the
gift is considered inappropriate;

•  Gifts,  favours  or  services  provided to  a  CIHP  employee’s family,  when it  is  given  because  of  his/her
relationship  to  the  employee.  For  example,  it  would  be  inappropriate  to  hire  CIHP  employee’s  family
member who is not qualified for the position, if the only reason for hiring him/her is the relationship to the
CIHP employee

Exceptions to the rule:

-  Promotional or advertising items of nominal value, such as pens or note pads
-  Plaques or awards of nominal intrinsic value, meant primarily for display purpose
-
-  Gift items given during yuletide or other religious festive periods reasonably established that it is

14. Copyright, Plagiarism & Cheating:

By law, exclusive rights are conferred upon persons in respect of their creations and creative works for a
certain period of time. Such rights cover works such as books, computer programs, films, photographs,
artworks and other written materials like articles, abstracts and research findings. All staff must preserve
CIHP’s copyright interests and exercise care and due caution not to infringe the copyright interests of other
individuals or organisations also.

In the event that staff need to use copyrighted materials in their work, appropriate credits must be given to
the  original  author  of  the  work.  Where  the  authors  explicitly  require  that  written  permission  must  be
obtained, then this must be strictly followed before using the material. Failure to do this would amount to
plagiarism or copyright infringement which would be punishable by termination of employment.

Where  it  is  established  that  a  CIHP  staff  member  or  prospective  employee  committed  acts  related  to
cheating  in  the  course  of  a  performance  assessment  test  or  interview  process,  the  person  will  be
automatically disqualified and the results of such person will be cancelled. In addition, such candidate will
be blacklisted and will not be invited for future interviews in CIHP.

A CIHP Staff that is found culpable of offence related to cheating will be suspended from duty for two
weeks without pay.

computers and flash drives for unofficial assignments.

Staff must ensure that all CIHP equipment allotted to them are handled professionally and with due care at all
times.  Any missing or damaged program equipment must be reported officially within 48 hours of the occurrence,
to the State Program Manager if the incident happened in the state and Associate Director, Management Support
Services in case of central office. Where it is proven that the missing or damaged equipment was as a result of
negligence on the part of staff, staff will be responsible for cost of repair or replacement as applicable.

purposes. Personal phones should be used to place personal calls and limit the business time used for the
personal conversation in the office. Internet usage should only be used for appropriate sites and content
matter pertaining to Program operation and function. The following web content or usage is considered
unprofessional and not allowed by the Program and  will be followed by disciplinary measure: sexually
explicit material, downloaded music, games and other material  defined as such by CIHP leadership and
communicated to the employee(s).

2.  Equipment Return

Staff that  have  been  allocated an equipment  from  the  pool  for  program  activities  or  special  assignment
within or outside the office must return such equipment not later than 48 hours after completion of the
activity.  The  Admin  staff  responsible  for  Inventory/  fixed  asset  management  must  keep  record  of  all
allocated equipment, their location and condition at all times.
Employees shall return any materials, equipment, or funds belonging to the program before their last day
of employment.  The employee will be held responsible, at the discretion of the Chief Executive Officer,
for replacement and repair of any materials or equipment damaged through negligence.

3.  Financial Responsibility

Advanced money to employees is solely used for approved Program specific purposes and to follow the
financial  policies  and  procedures  of  CIHP.  Any  outstanding  advances  as  of  the  employee’s  last  day  of
employment will be deducted from any funds due to the employee.
All CIHP staff are expected to exercise all due diligence in the handling of funds. Payments for program
activities, goods or services should be effected electronically in line with prevailing government regulations
relating to same. The handling and payment of cash for official transactions is strongly discouraged unless
under exceptional conditions with prior approval from the Chief Executive Officer or Director of Finance
and Subcontracts. In the event of any theft or loss of program funds due to negligence or contravention of
this or any other Operational Manual, any staff found to be culpable for the theft or loss shall be deemed to
have contravened the provisions on gross misconduct.
Since loss or theft of program funds is not covered by insurance, such culpable staff will be responsible for
refunding the missing amount of money and in addition be disciplined for such misconduct appropriately.

4.  Office Security

No part of this publication may be reproduced, distributed, or transmitted in any form or by any means, including photocopying,

All employees that have been authorized to handle office keys must under no circumstance give them to
non-employees.  If  the  keys  are  lost/misplaced  or  stolen,  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Director,
Management Support Services must be notified. The Administrative Officer must keep a log of all staff
allocated keys to the office.

5.  Loss of Personal Property on CIHP premises

CIHP will not be liable for any loss of personal property  by employees or their visitors while on  CIHP
premises. If for any reasons an employee needs to make use of their personal property on CIHP premises,
such employees are expected to take adequate measures to secure their property.

6.  Use of Personal vehicles for CIHP activities

CIHP does not expect, require, or encourage any of its employees to use their private vehicles for program
activities.  However,  under  certain  circumstances  during  times  of  heavy  program  activities  or  where  it
becomes imperative for personal vehicle to be used (to ensure safety, and urgently get the job done on time),
an employee may use his/her own vehicle. When an employee needs to use his/her personal vehicle for
official business, s/he will be reimbursed at the applicable rate per kilometer on the date of occurrence.
An employee in unavoidable circumstances requiring use of his/her personal vehicle for CIHP activities is
expected to immediately seek/obtain the prior approval for the use of the vehicle from the Chief Executive
Officer, or  designate; He/she should maintain accurate records of each trip made with their personal vehicle
using the Travel Business Expense report Form. It is mandatory for staff using their personal vehicles for
official business to have appropriate insurance. (See SOPs)

Employees using the Program vehicle are expected to abide by all traffic laws in Nigeria (seatbelts, speed
limits, road signs, no smoking, etc.). If an employee commits a traffic violation, s/he is responsible for
payment of any and all fines and may be subject to disciplinary action as deemed appropriate by the Chief
Executive Officer.

7.  Use of CIHP Vehicles for Personal Business

Business  use  of  vehicles  will  always  take  precedence  over  personal  use  of  CIHP  vehicles.    When  not
required for official business trips, vehicles may, with the specific written consent of the Chief Executive
Officer, be used on authorized personal business. However, personal use of project vehicles should be for
non-commercial purposes based on exigencies and are subject to approval by the CEO. Such approval by
the  Chief  Executive  Officer  for  personal  use  of  CIHP  vehicles  by  staff  may  be  considered  for  group
activities and will be reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer or designate on a case-by-case basis.

However, if an employee obtains approval to use a CIHP vehicle for personal business, the cost of fuel and
oil consumed must be calculated and recovered using the applicable CIHP mileage rate as baseline. The
Administrative Officer should ensure compliance. Additionally, the staff member using an official vehicle
for personal purposes must assume responsibility for any damage to the vehicle and hence be required to
meet the cost of repairs in cases where damage or accident is the result of negligent act or omission.

Personal  usage  during  business  hours  is  discouraged  except  for  extreme  emergencies.    All  personal
telephone calls should be kept brief to avoid congestion on the telephone line.

Director, Deputy Director, Associate Director, Senior Manager, Manager and other designated essential
staff will be given a smart phone to facilitate communication. Disengaged staff will hand over the sim and

XIV.   TRAINING AND STAFF DEVELOPMENT

1.  It  is  within  CIHP’s  policy  to  give  employees  opportunities  to  develop  or  improve  their  skills  and

knowledge consistent with CIHP program objectives and subject to fund availability.

training is initiated by CIHP or by the employee) shall on return from such training submit a training
report,  indicating  how  the  new  skills  and  knowledge  acquired  will  be  applied  to  improve  his/her
performance on the job. The Supervisor shall monitor the performance of staff on returning to work

advances  shall  be  issued  to  employees  who  have  more  than  one  non-retired  travel  advances  from
previous trips.

4.  Staff  travelling  on  CIHP  business  will  receive  Meals  and  Incidental  Expenses  (M&I  E)  allowance

which is intended to cover travel expenses such as meals, and other incidental expenses.

No receipts are required for expenses covered under M&IE.

hotel room charge paid by CIHP, reduced rates of M&IE will be paid.

6.  Rates for M& IE vary from location to location in Nigeria and will be subject to 6 monthly reviews by

other  forms  of  transportation  etc.    Such  expenses  must  be  itemized  on  a  TBER  and  approved  by  the
employee's supervisor prior to reimbursement. All items on a Travel Business Expense Report (TBER)
must be supported by appropriate receipts.

XVI.   DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS & SEPARATION FOR CAUSE

CIHP  expects  high  standards  of  behavior  from  its  employees  and  staff.  Employees  that  behave  in
unacceptable  fashion  or  violate  Program  rules,  regulations  and  policies  will  face  disciplinary  sanctions
proportional to the gravity of the offense they have committed. Disciplinary actions are as follows:

1.  Oral Warning

An oral warning is normally made by the immediate supervisor and/ Chief Executive Officer.

2.  Written Reprimand

 This is generally issued after an oral warning has been made with no subsequent improvement in behavior,
or when the severity of the misconduct warrants documentation. A copy of the reprimand will be placed in
the employee’s Employee file, for consideration during the annual performance evaluation.

3.  Suspension Without Pay

An employee can be suspended without pay for up to ten (10) days per violation, or thirty (30) days per
calendar year. Suspension can be administered when the two actions above have not been successful, or
when the gravity of the offence is so critical for continuation of employment that a more severe corrective
measure needs to be taken.  A disciplinary infringement is considered to be serious when it is particularly
intentional, cyclical, and exposes the Program to undue risk.

4.  Separation For Cause

Employee’s unsatisfactory performance or gross misconduct will result in separation for cause. Employees
who are recommended for involuntarily termination by their supervisor shall be terminated in writing and
receive  30  days  notice  with  approval from  the  Chief  Executive  Officer.    At  the  discretion  of  the  Chief
Executive Officer the employee may receive 30 days salary in lieu of notice for immediate termination.
Reasons  for  termination  shall  be  fully  documented  by  the  supervisor  and  placed  in  the  employee’s
Employee file.

XVII.   TERMINATION POLICIES

Provided that CIHP shall observe all applicable sections of Nigeria Labor Law, termination and or dismissal
for cause may occur as a result of:

1.  Repeated absenteeism, tardiness or unauthorized absence from work;
2.  Insubordination  or  refusal  to  accept  legal  orders  and  work  assignments  arising  out  of  the

employment contract;

3.  Misconduct, including drug and/or alcohol use or possession in the workplace;

4.  Unsatisfactory performance of duties;
5.  Failure to comply with rules, regulations and policies, oral or written;
6.  Sexual or other harassment;
7.  Gross negligence;
8.  Conviction for a criminal offense.
9.  Fraudulent misrepresentation of employment information

1.  Gross Misconduct

Gross misconduct will result in immediate termination.  Gross misconduct includes misappropriation,
negligent and/ unauthorized use of CIHP funds, equipment and property; violent behavior or assault;
harassing  or  threatening  use  of  email  and  other  IT  systems  including  display  of  offensive,  sexual
material in the workplace etc; attempts to defeat CIHP’s IT system security; and illegal use of email
and other IT systems such as violation of civil law including promoting pyramid schemes; promoting
prostitution;  receiving,  transmitting  or  possessing  child  pornography;  infringing  copyrights;  and
making  bomb  threats  or  involvement  in  any  other  terrorism-related  activity,  and  plagiarism  and
copyright infringement.

Failure  to  switch  off  and  unplug  electrical  appliances  after  close  of  work  will  constitute  gross
misconduct, and will be dealt with as provided for in the employee policy and procedure manual, and
shall attract appropriate punitive measures.

Procedure for handling cases of gross misconduct
For any act of gross misconduct, the following procedure will be applied
a)  Investigation. An investigator or panel of investigators will be assigned by the Chief Executive Officer
to investigate and report findings. It is expected that the investigator/panel will gather information as
soon as possible by speaking to witness (es) and concerned parties while memories are still fresh. They
should also take statement from witnesses and concerned parties. As much as possible they should also
collect relevant documents and materials as evidence.

At  the  end  of  the  investigation,  the  investigator/panel  should  write  a  comprehensive  report
detailing the findings of the investigation.

b)  Disciplinary  hearing/interview.  Report  of  the  investigator(s)  should  be  forwarded  to  the  Chief
Executive Officer who will determine the constitution of a disciplinary committee to interview the staff.
If constituted, the committee should follow the following procedure
i)

Before  the  interview.  In  advance  of  the  hearing,  the  employee  accused  of  the  misconduct
should be informed by the committee in writing of the purpose of the interview, the alleged
offence and should be given copies of any supporting documents or statement and be informed
in writing the penalty if the allegation is upheld.
At  the  interview.  No  decision  concerning  disciplinary  action  should  be  taken  until  the
interview has concluded. The staff should be given full opportunity to respond. At the end of
the interview, decision should be collectively agreed by the panel or at least by the majority.
The committee should advise the employee of his/her right of appeal.
The Staff may nominate one individual to serve as his/ her witness during the interview. The
witness must be a staff of CIHP.

Employee Policy and Procedure Manual, Revised March, 2016

36

c)  In the event that the allegation of gross misconduct has been established, (i.e. following due process of
investigation  and  disciplinary  hearing  as  stated  above),  the  Disciplinary  Committee  will  make
recommendations on the appropriate penalty suitable for the offence, to the Chief Executive Officer.
The recommended penalty may range from suspension without pay for  ten to fifteen working days, to
summary dismissal in the most serious cases.

d)  The right of appeal: The right of appeal only exists where an employee has been recommended for
summary  dismissal.  Where  an  employee  has  been  recommended  for  dismissal,  he/she  should  be
informed in writing that he/she has the right to appeal if he/she thinks they have been treated unfairly.
The appeal must state the reason why the employee disagrees with the decision that has been made and
be sent to the Chief Executive Officer within five working days of the decision being communicated to
him or her. The Chief Executive Officer will constitute a panel to hear the appeal. The panel will be
made up of senior staff, including at least one member of the Senior Management Team. The appeal
must be resolved within 10 working days and the decision of the Committee shall be final.

Where an employee chooses to exercise his/ her right of appeal, no salary will be paid in the period up to
the  appeal  decision  being  communicated.    However,  if  the  appeal  is  successful  and  the  employee  is
reinstated, he/she will be paid all salaries in arrears due for the period. No other compensation will be paid
to the employee.

2.  Reduction in Workforce

At  any  time,  funding  may  terminate  or  decrease  dictating  a  reduction  in  the  staff  strength  of  the
organization. As a result, the organization may have to reduce or terminate some of its workforce. CIHP
will make every effort to inform staff as far in advance as possible of such reduction or termination. All
such terminated employees will be eligible for all benefits as outlined in the Voluntary Termination section
below. Notice period will be in line with the notice period required for such a post.

3.  Voluntary Termination

Voluntary termination may be by either the employee or the organization. This shall be done in writing and
will  be  in  line  with the  notice  period  for  that  position.  Earned  unused  vacation  time  within  the  year  of
termination shall be paid to the employee upon the employee’s termination; unused sick leave will not be
paid to the employee. Vacation shall not be taken from the time that an employee gives notice, or is given
notice until his/her last day of employment without the prior approval of the Chief Executive Officer.

a. Failure to provide notice of termination by the employer or employee

Should either party fail to give the required 30 or 60 calendar days’ advance notice of termination, the non-
breaching party is entitled to payment at a rate equal to the employee’s last monthly base salary under this
agreement for the number of days short of the required notice period worked after providing the notice of
termination.

Where an employee is terminated for cause, they are not eligible for any payments in lieu of notice-it is
with immediate effect. CIHP will not be liable for salary or related costs beyond the date of employment
termination. All obligations/debits owed -CIHP must be paid before/by last working day.

No part of this publication may be reproduced, distributed, or transmitted in any form or by any means, including photocopying,

Employee Policy and Procedure Manual, Revised March, 2016

37

In  a  case  where  an  employee  makes  the  choice  to  terminate  the  employment  contract  by  submitting  a
resignation, notice of an acceptance or non-acceptance shall be given within three working days of such
submission. This is to verify that there are no pending issues against the Employee.

Where the Employee does not wait for a notice accepting his/her resignation by CIHP, such an employee
will be deemed to have abandoned his/her employment and the salary will be paid till last day worked. The
liability for the days in lieu of notice will be claimed from terminal benefits.

b.  Notice Period

For purposes of termination of appointment either by the employer or employee, the following notice must
be observed or money paid in lieu of the notice period except in cases of gross misconduct on the part of
the employee. Payment in lieu of notice will be the basic salary only.

  Grade
1  CIHP Band 7 – 10
2  CIHP Band 1 – 6

Notice period
60 days
30 days

4.  Advance Reconciliation

Any outstanding advances as of the employee’s last day of employment will be deducted from any funds
due to the employee

5.  Handing Over Processes

Once a resignation letter is received, HR Unit will inform the IT, Finance and Procurement Units within
one week of receipt of resignation letter. IT will carry out necessary back up of the work of the staff while
Finance Unit will reconcile accounts of the staff. Resigned staff will prepare and share his/her handing over
notes (including current/pending activities status)with his/her line Manager. If state office staff, handing
over notes will also be shared with the thematic lead/unit head at Central Office.  Line Manager and central
office thematic lead/unit head must provide feedback on handing over notes at least 7 days before the final
exit date of staff. All handing over notes must be finalized and certified by the supervisor 2 days before
final  exit  date.  Payment  of  final  entitlements  is  contingent  upon  satisfactory  handing  over  all  CIHP
documents (hard and electronic copies) and properties under the custody of staff, clearance by Finance unit,
and certification by the line manager/Unit Head.

XVIII.  GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES

Grievance procedures are procedures whereby employees can raise their dissatisfaction in respect to any
decisions taken on them.  They are aimed at settling a grievance fairly and quickly and to help prevent
minor disagreements developing into more serious disputes.

No part of this publication may be reproduced, distributed, or transmitted in any form or by any means, including photocopying,
recording, or other electronic or mechanical methods, without the prior written permission of CIHP, except in the case of brief
quotations embodied in critical reviews and certain other non-commercial uses permitted by copyright law.

Employee Policy and Procedure Manual, Revised March, 2016

38

CIHP encourages a climate of mutual respect, openness, and understanding among all staff.  It is obvious
that the absence of these may lead to grievances and subsequently to an undesirable working atmosphere.
Situations will and do arise in the office that need to be handled procedurally, which is why this section is
in place.

It  is  expected  that  if  an  employee  has  a  work-related  problem,  he/she  will  discuss  it  first  with  his/her
supervisor.  If such a discussion is not possible or is inappropriate, he/she should discuss it with the Chief
Executive Officer or Director, Management Support Services.

The objective of the grievance procedure is to resolve disputes as quickly and fairly as possible.  If an
employee  feels  at  any  time  that  disciplinary  action  taken  against  him/her  is  unfair,  or  he/she  has  any
grievance against the Program, he/she may invoke the grievance procedure as follows:

Any grievance must first be raised with the employee’s supervisor.  Every effort must be made by both
parties to resolve the grievance. If no satisfactory settlement can be reached, the grievance will be referred
to the Chief Executive Officer for resolution.

If  a  grievance  is  raised  during  disciplinary  procedures,  notice  of  dismissal  may  not  be  given  until  the
grievance is resolved.

The decision of the Chief Executive Officer on the issue is considered final unless the grievance is against
the Chief Executive Officer, in which case the issue will be decided by the Board of Trustees/ Board of
Directors.

  An Employee Biographical Data Form duly completed. (see Appendix)
