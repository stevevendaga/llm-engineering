18.1  Background of CIHP

The  Center  for  Integrated  Health  Programs  (CIHP)  is  a  leading  non-governmental,  non-profit
organization that promotes better healthcare for all through the creation of strong and sustainable
health systems. Established with the support of the US Government President’s Emergency Plan
for  AIDS  Relief  (PEPFAR),  CIHP  is  the  successor  organization  to  Columbia  University’s
Mailman  School  of  Public  Health  Nigeria  LLC’s  Track  1.0  funded  HIV  Prevention,  Care  and
Treatment activities in Nigeria. The organization will sustain the International Center for AIDS
Care  and  Treatment  Programs  (ICAP)’s  achievements  and  successes  in  service  delivery,
monitoring,  evaluation,  and  training/education  in  Nigeria.  In  addition,  CIHP  will  utilize  its
indigenous professional expertise, experience and technical resources to implement programs and
adopt broad-based innovative strategies to address other key health and development issues to help
fast-track the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals 4, 5 and 6 in Nigeria by 2015.

18.2  Purpose of Procurement Guidelines

The purpose of these guidelines is to provide a strategic framework and direction for efficient and
effective management of procurement processes in CIHP. This document outlines the applicable
policies and procedures and also explain the responsibility and accountability of those involved in
the procurement process in line with best practices. This is to ensure that the  organization gets
value for money in all procurement transactions.

For the purpose of these guidelines, Procurement is any transaction or activity entered into for the
purpose of obtaining goods and services in furtherance of the objectives of the organization.
These guidelines contain actions to be taken on procurement of goods and services as stipulated in
the SOPs and other guiding rules and provisions on Programs funded by the US Government and
other  donors.  It  is  the  responsibility  of  all  CIHP  staff  to  know  and  adhere  to  these  governing
regulations as they apply to procurement, as well as to other areas of CIHP operations.

18.3  Definition of Procurement

Procurement is a process, which is defined as the acquisition of property, equipment, goods, works
or services through purchase, hire, lease, rental or exchange from any source. Actions undertaken
to  carry  out  procurement  are  defined  as  procurement  activities,  which  include  all  actions  from
planning and forecasting, identification of needs, sourcing and solicitation of offers, evaluation of
offers, review and award of contracts, contracting and all phases of contract administration until
delivery of the goods, the end of a contract, or the useful life of an asset.

A specified series of procurement activities, which have to  be executed in  the same manner in
order to obtain the same result under the same circumstances, is thereby defined as procurement
procedures.

The scope of procurement is limited to commercial activities, and does not include agreements,
grants and public private sector partnerships, which are subject to other financial regulations and

rules. Selection and administration of individual contractors and consultants remain in the human
resources  domain  and  therefore  those  guidelines  are  not  included  in  this  manual  but  can  be
obtained in the Employee Policy and procedure manual.

18.4  General Procurement Principles

The procurement functions include all actions necessary for the acquisition, by purchase or lease,
of property, including products and real property, and of services, including works. The CEO may
delegate authority, as appropriate, for such procurement functions.

The  following  general  principles  shall  be  given  due  consideration  when  exercising  the
procurement functions of CIHP:
  Best value for money;

  Fairness, integrity and transparency;

  Effective  national  and  international  competition  subject  to  applicable  donor

regulations;

  Quality services that will be provided in accordance with the stipulated TOR, within

the time allotted and at a fair and reasonable price;

  Works that are contracted for at the most advantageous cost and terms, carried out in a
competent  manner  according  to  design,  and  will  be  completed  and  accepted  by  the
target date without cost-overruns and reservations;

  Goods  that  meet  technical  specifications  and  local  service  conditions  at  most
advantageous cost and arrive in good condition at the project site in a timely manner.

  Economy and efficiency, and
  The interests of CIHP.

As regards economy and efficiency, particular attention should be paid to maximizing the use of
bulk orders for standard supplies and confirming current and foreseeable orders for similar items
from the same source.

18.5  Conflict of Interest

CIHP respects the rights of its staff relative to activities outside this employment which are private
and which do not conflict with or reflect adversely upon CIHP. Similarly, employees are asked to
refrain  from  any  activity  that  would  negatively  influence  CIHP  or  its  ability  to  do  business  in
Nigeria or elsewhere.

CIHP employees are expected to promote CIHP’s interests and to refrain from using their position
in the organization to supplement their incomes directly or indirectly, or to obtain other material
benefits including gifts.

Section 18: Procurement Guidelines, Revised May, 2014

An employee of CIHP may perform work or services for other organizations only to the extent that
the activity does not prevent the employee from devoting the time and effort to CIHP business that
her/his position requires, and such work takes place outside business hours.

CIHP staff may not, directly or indirectly, be financially engaged or involved in any enterprise or
program to which CIHP is providing assistance; or an activity being performed with funding from
the USG and its entities.

No staff member should knowingly act in a capacity, or urge the organization to act in a manner
designed  to  confer  any  financial  or  commercial  benefit,  whether  actual  or  potential,  on  her  or
himself (including family members), or on any firm or corporation in which s/he has a significant
interest as partner, stockholder, director or officer. CIHP, as a general rule, does not enter into
purchasing  contracts  with  staff or members of their immediate  families.  An acquisition from a
business  in  which  a  CIHP  employee  has  an  interest  is  prohibited  unless  full  disclosure  of  the
background facts are presented in writing to the Chief Executive Officer and approved. Interest is
deemed  present  if  the  CIHP  employee  and/or  his  or  her  spouse  or  partner  or  children  own  ten
percent  (10%)  or  more  of  the  assets  of  a  business.  No  CIHP  employee,  officer,  or  agent  shall
participate in the selection, award, or administration of a purchasing contract supported by U.S.
government/donor funds if such participation would involve a real or apparent conflict of interest.
Information obtained because of employment at CIHP that is not generally available to the public
should  not  be  communicated  to  any  individual(s)  or  organization(s)  outside  CIHP.  The
organization  reserves  the  exclusive  right  to  determine  what  information  can  or  cannot  be
communicated outside the organization.

CIHP  strives  to  be  in  strict  compliance  with  all  laws  and  regulations  that  are  applicable  to  its
activities. In the event that a regulation is ambiguous or difficult to interpret, CIHP has access to
legal counsel to determine compliance with a policy and observance of all laws and regulations.
Such advice shall be sought if any questions arise.

18.6  Procurement Modalities

Entering into procurement by contract: No contract shall be entered into on behalf of CIHP


except by the CEO;


Cooperating with other national and international organizations: The CEO may cooperate
with  other  organizations  to  meet  the  procurement  requirements  of  CIHP,  provided  that  the
regulations  and  rules  of  those  organizations  are  consistent  with  those  of  CIHP.  The  CEO,  as
appropriate, may enter into agreements for such purposes. Such cooperation may include carrying
out  common  procurement  actions  together,  or  CIHP  may  enter  into  a  contract  relying  on  a
procurement decision of another organization, or may request another organization  to carry out
procurement activities on behalf of CIHP, and


Cooperating  with  Government  and  other  organizations:  The  CEO  may,  to  the  extent
authorized by relevant legislation of the Board of Directors, cooperate with a Government, non-

governmental organization, or other public international organization, in respect of procurement
activities, and enter into agreements for such purposes.

18.6.1  Award of Procurement Contracts on the Basis of Formal Methods of Solicitation

The  award  of  a  contract  shall  be  made  after  due  consideration  has  been  given  to  the  general
principles  described  in  general  procurement  principles  above  and  in  accordance  with  the
following:

  When a formal invitation to bid has been issued, the procurement contract shall be awarded
to the qualified bidder whose bid substantially conforms to requirements set forth in the
solicitation documentation and offers the lowest cost to CIHP.

  When a formal request for proposals has been issued, the procurement contract shall be
awarded  to  the  qualified  proposer  whose  proposal,  all  factors  considered,  is  the  most
responsive to the requirements set forth in the solicitation documentation.

  The  CEO  may,  in  the  interests  of  the  program,  reject  bids  or  proposals  for  a  particular
procurement  action,  recording  the  reasons  for  rejection  in  writing.  The  CEO  shall  then
determine whether to undertake a new solicitation or to negotiate a procurement contract
directly pursuant to “Award of procurement contracts on the basis of exceptions to the use
of  formal  methods  of  solicitation”  section  below,  or  to  terminate  or  to  suspend  the
procurement action.

18.6.2  Award of Procurement Contracts on the Basis of Exceptions to the Use of Formal

Methods of Solicitation

  The CEO may determine for a particular procurement action that using formal methods of

solicitation is not in the best interest of CIHP when:

  The  value  of  the  procurement  is  below  the  monetary  amount  established  for  formal

methods of solicitation;

  There is no competitive market-place for the requirement, such as where a monopoly exists,
where prices are fixed by legislation or government regulation, or where the requirement
involves a proprietary product or service;

  There has been a previous determination or there is a need to standardize the requirement;
  The proposed procurement contract is the result of cooperation with other organizations,

pursuant to “Procurement Modalities” section above;

  Offers  for  identical  requirements  have  been  obtained  competitively  within  a  reasonable

period and the prices and conditions offered remain competitive.

  A formal solicitation has not produced satisfactory results within a reasonable prior period.
  The proposed procurement contract is to purchase or lease real property;
  There is a genuine exigency for the requirement.
  The proposed procurement contract relates to obtaining services that cannot be objectively

evaluated.

  The CEO otherwise determines that a formal solicitation will not give satisfactory results.

When a decision is made pursuant to the above, the CEO shall record the reasons in writing and
constitute a committee that may then collectively award a procurement contract, either on the basis
of an informal method of solicitation, or on the basis of a directly negotiated contract, to a qualified
vendor whose offer substantially conforms to the requirements at an acceptable price.

18.7  Guidelines for Procurement Requests:

A.    Any CIHP employee , who needs goods or services to be procured, in furtherance of CIHP
Programs shall complete a Purchase Requisition Form which must be endorsed by his/her
line  manager  after  confirming  that  the  item  being  requested  is  allowable  under  the
applicable donor regulation and has been included in an approved budget for the fiscal year
(s). Strong justification is required for essential goods or services which hitherto were not
covered in the fiscal year budget but crucial for program implementation. The requisition
form will be forwarded to the appropriate Director (in the case of central office) or Director,
State  Coordination  (in  the  case  of  State  offices)  for  recommendation  to  the  CEO  or
designate  for  approval.  All  approved  requisitions  forms  will  be  passed  to  the  Senior
HR/Administration Manager for further necessary action.

B.

C.

Specifications and class of the goods or services (e.g. IT, medical furniture, facility repairs,
reagent, office stationery, etc.) to be procured should be clearly indicated on the Purchase
Requisition Form. Evidence of usage of the last batch purchased, e.g. bin card should be
provided where necessary.

For the purpose of coordination and follow-up at the central office, approved requisitions
should be sent to Senior HR/Administration Manager or designation or before COB every
Wednesday.  The  senior  HR/Administration  manager  or  designate  will  collate  the
requisitions every Thursday and forward the grid and the scanned approved request forms
to  the Director, supply chain  management or designate by  Friday of the  same week for
necessary action. In cases if exigencies, some approved purchase requests can be processed
before Friday.

18.8  The Procurement Process:

A.

The  Director,  Supply  Chain  Management  or  designate  will  keep  an  electronic  register,
called the Tracking Log for registration of approved purchase requisitions for follow up
and  to  ensure  transparency.  This  register  will  also  serve  as  a  historical  record  of  the
procurements  of  goods  or  services  that  have  been  processed  by  the  Supply  Chain
Management unit.

B.

A Procurement file must be opened and updated regularly with the documents of every
procurement activity that has been processed, in addition to the Tracking Log for future
references.

recording, or other electronic or mechanical methods, without the prior written permission of CIHP, except in the case of brief
quotations embodied in critical reviews and certain other non-commercial uses permitted by copyright law.

C.

 Prequalified vendors will submit quotes for procurement of goods or services for CIHP
sites and state offices but such bids will be submitted to and processed in Central office,
Abuja  (except  expressly  authorized  otherwise,  by  the  CEO).  Final  payment  for  jobs
executed  and  supplies  made  in  any  CIHP  offices  including  facility  repairs  will  only  be
made after certification of the job(s), in line with LPO and/or specifications, or delivery of
the  items  involved.  This  will  be  prepared  by  SPM/Designee,  acknowledge  by  Facility
Medical  Director,  and  reviewed  by  Facility  Maintenance  Co-coordinator.  However,  for
expediency, procurement of items with total value not more than N75,000.00 ($500 USD)
may be handled at the state level to meet exigencies but there must be an approved purchase
request form by the CEO or designate and such must also meet the requirements of these
guidelines.

D.

To  document  action  trails,  Senior  HR/Administration  Manager  or  designate  will
acknowledge the receipt of the approved requisition(s) from the office of CEO with date-
stamp. The Director, Supply Chain Management or designate will also acknowledge the
receipt of the collated approved procurement requests from the Senior HR/Administration
Manager or designate.

18.9  The Pre-Qualification Process

A.  Written Procurement Contracts:

Written procurement contracts or purchase orders shall be used to formalize every procurement
for  a  monetary  value  over  specific  thresholds  established  by  the  applicable  donor  and  relevant
guidelines. Such arrangements shall, as appropriate, in case of contract specify in detail:
• The nature of the products or services being procured;
• The quantity being provided;
• The contract price;
• The period covered;
• Conditions to be fulfilled, including the general conditions of contract;
• Terms of delivery and payment;
• Name and address of supplier.
In case of Purchase Order:
• The exact description of the goods;
• The quantity required;
• The price of each article;
• The condition at the time of delivery;
• The general conditions of the Purchase Order, and
• The conditions of delivery and the terms of payments.

B.  To ensure effective control and documentation in order to minimize errors, irregularities
and  legal  risk  as  well  as  aiding,  control  consciousness  of  responsible  personnel,  the
Purchase  Order  (LPO)  is  prepared  by  the  Procurement  Officer/Facility  Maintenance

Coordinator, the second stage of verification is done by Director of Procurement and SCM
who ensures that all procedures are effectively followed and in line with the SOP, the third
level of verification is done by the Director of Finance and Sub Contract who in addition
ensure that all items/services are accommodated in the Budget. The final approval is done
by the Chief Executive Officer of CIHP based on recommendations and verification by the
two level directors.

C.  The Director, Supply Chain Management shall develop a data base of pre-qualified vendors
in order to have a pool of contacts to hasten the process of calling for bids and also ensure
competitiveness  and
the  Senior  Facility
transparency.  For  repairs/  renovations,
Maintenance Associate shall maintain a data base of prices of building materials (price list)
in categories, in addition to BOQs. These are to be reviewed on a quarterly basis to form a
bench mark for comparison with bid prices and facilitate negotiations of the bids.

D.  The  pre-qualification  review  should  be  independently  handled  by  a  Procurement

Committee (PC) set up for that purpose.

E.  The invitation for bids can be conducted through one or by a combination of any of the

following means:

i.

ii.

iii.
iv.

v.

By  advertisement  –  in  any  news  media  –  papers,  radios/TVs  and/or  public
places/locations.
On phone with any of the pre-qualified vendors, or new ones subject to verification by
the PC.
By e-mail, or dispatched invitation letters
A copy of the Request for Quotation (RFQ) is placed on the Notice Board provided at
the entrance gate within the period of solicitation or duration of the RFQ.
Direct contact by visitation (although not encouraged), and also subject to verification
by PC.

F.  It is estimated that it will take about seven (7) to ten (10) working days `from the time the
approved purchase requisition is received by the procurement unit, up to the time sealed
bids/quotations are received from suppliers. Maximum of two (2) days would be required
for  the  PC  to  meet  and  finalize  the  review  process;  and  one  day  for  the  Procurement
Manager  to  collate  the  PC’s  recommendations,  and  raise  a  memo  and  LPO  in  favor  of
recommended vendor. The documents are then submitted to the CEO for consideration and
possible  approval.  Completing  a  procurement  process  would  take  about  thirteen  (13)
working days (about three weeks).

Staff are therefore advised to submit their requisitions in good time recognizing the turnaround
time for processing. Some jobs, like printing and facility repairs may require more than three (3)
weeks  to  process.  For  the  purpose  of  clarity,  the  following  time  lines  are  considered  for  some
procurements:

H. The Director, SCM or designate shall call for bids/quotations from pre-qualified vendors for
procurements with a total cost of N75, 000.00 (US$500) and above. This will be in line with the
approval limits in accordance with the table below after the sign-off of the CEO or designate. A
copy of the letter of invitation for bids should be given to the PC on the bid review day with a copy
kept in the Procurement file.
I. Procurement of office supplies, food bank stuffs, and items of substantial amounts like printing,

etc., should be done in bulk to take advantage of quantity discounts on bulk purchases.

J. The Director, SCM or designate should determine the appropriate re-order levels to avoid stock

outs and over-stocking.

K. Purchasing authorities are subject to overall authority levels depending on donor requirements.
Please, note that these guidelines relate to all purchases of goods and services, including
major equipment and property leases. Also, the limits below are based on the cumulative
purchase value not a “per unit” cost.

18.10 The Bidding Process:

A.   Whether the purchase is made through the Central Office or donors/funders, the appropriate
number of bids/quotes as per the chart above must be obtained. Requirements of the bids
include:

  All bids/quotes must be in English, otherwise key elements must be translated.
  Pro-forma  invoice  may  be  used  as  quotes  but  are  not  acceptable  for  payment.  Stamped

receipts from the vendor are required.

B.

The prospective supplier(s) should be given equal access to relevant information on the bid
requirements. However, no prospective renovation/ repair vendor should be privy to the
budgetary  provision  or  the  BOQ  prices  of  the  items  for  which  s/he  is  bidding.  Any
indication  to  suggest  that  the  vendor(s)  has/ve  a  prior  knowledge  of  the  budgetary
provision,  or  BOQ  prices  of  the  items,  will  lead  to  cancellation  of  such  bid  and  the
vendor(s) will be delisted from the list of pre-qualified vendors.

The  selected  bidders  should  send  their  quotations/bids  in  sealed  signed  envelopes,  with
their company stamp on both the quotations and the envelopes should be brought physically
(or  by  courier)  to  the  CIHP  office  in  Wuse  II,  Abuja.  Vendors  will  drop  the  sealed
envelopes in the Procurement locked box kept at CIHP front office at the ground floor.
Bids  may  be  submitted  through  a  CIHP  designated  e-mail  address  to  be  accessed  by  a
designated IT staff who will print such bids for the PC after the submission deadline.

No  multiple  bids  will  be  allowed  from  the  same  company  or  individual  or  multiple
companies  owned  by  the  same  individual(s)  or  entity(s).  Any  company  found  to  be
involved in this act will have its bids disqualified and such company will be delisted from
the pre-qualified vendors’ list.

If the item to be procured is of a specialized nature which only one vendor (sole source)
has the franchise to supply, such vendor shall be considered on its own merit. If eventually
found qualified or successful, it shall be added to the pre-qualified list. The vendor’s profile
may be submitted in a different envelope for processing by the Procurement staff. This also
applies to sole- source Procurements. Single source vendor can also be where a prequalified
vendor has been considered for a supply (through competitive bidding process) and there
is need for such item within six month from date of initial supply.

Quotations/bids are submitted on the vendor’s letterhead. In a situation where the letterhead
is  not  available,  a  paper  marked  with  the  vendor’s  official  stamp,  contact  address  and
telephone numbers will suffice.

 The keys for the locked box will always be kept with Compliance Officer till the day of
opening of the bids by the PC.
The box will be opened  by the Chairperson of the PC (as appointed by the Director of
Finance  and  Sub-contracts  or  designate)  on  the  bid  review  day  in  the  presence  of  all
committee members.

The PC may not consider any bid that is not sealed and did not have the vendor’s stamp
and signature on both the quotation and the envelope.

If  the  PC  requires  technical  advice,  especially  on  the  specifications  and  quality  of  the
item(s),  this  will  be  sought  from  the  user  (thematic  area  focal  person),  but  such  a
representative will not have any voting rights in the meeting. The PC shall document the
thematic area focal person/user’s input.

The  Requisitioner  shall  not  interfere  with  the  selection  and  procurement  processes.  A
vendor that allows the involvement of a Requisitioner in the procurement process will be
disqualified from future invitation for quotations.

The PC will review the sealed bids/quotations and make recommendations:
I.to accept any of the offers;
II. to further negotiate with one or more of the vendors;
III. to ask for clarification from vendors;
IV. to reject the offers and ask for fresh quotations/bids.
All discussions/negotiations shall be properly documented. Where the item specifications
change as a result of decisions by the PC or for any other reason(s), fresh quotations shall
be sought. The PC will contribute to ensuring that all procurement is done in accordance
with USG, donors/funders and CIHP regulations, and ensure value for money.
The Procurement Officer, who also carries no voting rights at the meeting shall prepare the
minutes of the PC’s meeting within 24 hours of completing the meeting for signature of
the committee members.
The Procurement Officer and the thematic area focal person will only sign as observers.
Where a member of the PC has a dissenting opinion on the final decision, this opinion shall
be  noted  in  the  comments  section  of  the  report.  A  decision  shall  then  be  made  by  the
majority. The CEO may however override the committee’s recommendation.

Each PC member in attendance shall sign and date the Procurement Bids Review Summary
Report. The signed summary report should be an attachment to other relevant procurement
documents  and  submitted  to  the  CEO  for  consideration  and  approval.  Copies  of  the
document  shall  be  kept  in  the  Procurement  unit  file  for  future  reference.  In  the  case  of
goods and services including facility repairs for use by sub-recipients, a set of the relevant
documents must be given to the Sub-Contract Unit for their file.
