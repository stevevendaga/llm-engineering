2.1  INTRODUCTION

The  Standard  Operating  Procedure  (SOP)  Manual  is  the  official  compilation  of  CIHP's
financial and administrative policies and procedures. The policies, procedures and other
information  in  the  manual  are  derived  from  sources  such  as  decisions  of  the  Board  of
Trustees,  operating
review  of  organizational
requirements,  procedural  studies,
responsibilities, standard practices and legal requirements.

The  documentation  of  the  organization's  policies  and  procedures  promotes  the
standardization  and  simplification  of  financial  and  administrative  functions  and  is  a
reference  for  those  who  have  administrative  and  financial  responsibilities.  The
Management  Support  Services  Unit  is  responsible  for  coordinating  the  development  of
guidelines  to  ensure  consistent  formatting  of  this  information,  the  coordination  of
revisions/additions to policies and procedures, and the distribution of this information.

It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  unit  head  to  disseminate  information  pertinent  to  the
functions  of  subordinates  and  to  ensure  that  these  employees  are  aware  of,  understand
and comply with the issued policies and procedures in the Financial and Administrative
Policy and Procedure Manual.

CIHP Standard Operating Procedures

Violation  of  subsections  2.2,  2.3,  2.4,  2.7,  and  2.8  of  the  codes  of  conduct  constitutes
Gross Misconduct, and would be treated as stipulated in Section XIV of Employee Policy
& Procedure Manual.

The codes of conduct must be readily available to all staff including new employees who
must be provided with an orientation to the codes of conduct.

2.2  CONFLICT OF INTEREST

2.2.1  GENERAL

CIHP respects the rights of its employees regarding their activities that are outside their
employment, that are private, and that do not conflict with or reflect adversely upon the
organization.    However,  employees  are  asked  to  refrain  from  any  personal  activity  that
would negatively influence CIHP or its ability to do business in Nigeria or elsewhere.

CIHP staff are expected to promote its interests and to refrain from using their position in
the  organization  to  supplement  their  incomes  directly  or  indirectly,  or  to  obtain  other
material benefits including gifts other than those considered tokens. Notwithstanding all
gifts and tokens received by employees should be declared to the management and noted.

An employee may perform work or services for other organizations only to the extent that
the  activity  does  not  prevent  the  employee  from  devoting  the  time  and  effort  to  CIHP
business that her/his position requires.

CIHP strives to be in strict compliance with all laws and regulations that are applicable to
its activities.  In the event that a regulation is ambiguous or difficult to interpret, the Chief
Executive  Officer  and  management  may  contact  legal  counsel  to  determine  compliance
with a policy and observance of all laws and regulations.  Such advice shall be sought if
any questions arise.

2.2.2  POLITICAL ACTIVITY

Whereas  CIHP  employees  are  free  to  participate  in  political  processes,  they  may  not
under  any  circumstances  link  their  organization  to  their  political  activities  unless  stated
otherwise  by  the  organization.    Expatriate  employees  are  forbidden  to  interfere  in  the
internal political affairs of the country in which they are operating.

2.2.3  FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL BENEFIT

Staff may not, directly or indirectly, be financially engaged or involved in any enterprise
or project to which CIHP is providing assistance.

Section 2: Codes of Conduct

January 2012, Page 2-3

CIHP Standard Operating Procedures

No  staff  member  should  knowingly  act  in  a  capacity,  or  urge  CIHP  to  act  in  a  manner
designed  to  confer  any  financial  or  commercial  benefit,  whether  actual  or  potential,  on
her- or himself, or on any firm or corporation in which he/she has a significant interest as
partner,  stockholder,  director,  or  officer.    CIHP,  as  a  general  rule,  does  not  enter  into
purchasing contracts with staff or members of their immediate families.  An acquisition
from  a  business  in  which  a  CIHP  employee  has  an  interest  is  prohibited  unless  full
disclosure of the background facts are presented in writing to the Chief Executive Officer
and approved.  Interest is deemed present if the CIHP employee and/or his or her spouse
or  partner  or  children  own  ten  percent  (10%)  or  more  of  the  assets  of  a  business.    No
CIHP  employee,  officer,  or  agent  shall  participate  in  the  selection,  award,  or
administration  of  a  purchasing  contract  supported  by  U.S.  government  funds  if  such
participation would involve a real or apparent conflict of interest.

2.2.4  NEPOTISM

Relatives  of  CIHP  employees  and  other  job  applicants  in  a  close  personal  relationship
with an employee are generally considered for employment based on their qualifications
only.  However, where the employment of an employee’s family member or of a person
in  a  close  personal  relationship  with  an  employee  results  in  the  types  of  prohibited
employment relationships identified below, CIHP will not consider or accept applications
for employment.

Hiring of Relatives:  A relative is defined as a spouse, parent, grandparent, child, mother
or  father-in-law,  brother,  sister,  or  other  close  family  member.    Hiring  of  relatives  of
employees is prohibited if employment results in the creation of:

A  supervisory/subordinate  relationship  between  those  two  individuals.    If  a  direct  or
indirect  supervisory  or  managerial  relationship  would  be  established,  the  job  applicant
cannot be considered for an open position.

An actual conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest.  Generally, this
bars  employment  of  an  employee’s  family  member  who  has  an  auditing  or  control
relationship to the employee’s job.

Hiring  of  Partners  or  Those  in  a  Close  Personal  Relationship:    Two  employees  who
marry or establish a close personal relationship may continue in their current positions as
long  as  a  prohibited  employment  relationship  is  not  created.    If  one  of  the  situations
specified above does occur, attempts will be made to find another position within CIHP
to which one of the employees can transfer.  All practical efforts will be made to arrange
such a transfer at the earliest possible time.

CIHP  may  also  choose
to  ensure  no
supervisory/subordinate  relationship  exists  between  the  two  individuals  and  as  such,
permit continuation of both employees in their positions.

CIHP Standard Operating Procedures

If  accommodations  of  this  nature  are  not  feasible,  the  employees  will  be  permitted  to
determine  which  one  of  them  will  resign  within  a  specified  period.    If  neither  party
resigns,  CIHP  reserves  the  right  to  terminate  the  employment  of  both  for  operational
requirements.

2.2.5  ANNUAL CERTIFICATION OF COMPLIANCE

All Central and State office hires must obtain certification of compliance with CIHP’s
conflict of interest policy when first hired and on an annual basis thereafter.  Certification
is obtained by completing the Conflict of Interest certification form. Each year on the
anniversary of CIHP financial year end (1st October to 30th September) all staff will
receive a reminder to fill and send to Human Resource Unit.

An employee’s certification must be current in order for CIHP to include his/her salary
support on any funding proposal.

2.3  CONFIDENTIALITY

During  the  course  of  employment,  an  employee  may  have  access  to  confidential  or
proprietary information.  Examples of this type of information may include financial data,
patient  information/data,  computer  programs,  proposals,  documents,  procedures,  and
information  in  a  formative  stage.    This  information  may  be  the  property  of  CIHP,  or  a
client, e.g., CDC, USAID or other donors.  Other than in the course of their employment,
employees  are  prohibited  from  disclosing  such  information  to  parties  outside  of  CIHP
without  the  specific  consent  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  or  his/her  designate.
Disclosure of sensitive information such as salary data to other CIHP employees should
be  guided  by  common  sense  and  the  other  employee’s  genuine  need  to  know  such
information.    Any  questions  about  disclosure  of  proprietary  and  sensitive  information
should be referred to the CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, and/or Director, Management
Support Services.

2.4  SUBSTANCE-FREE WORKPLACE

CIHP operates a substance-free workplace in all CIHP locations.  Smoking is prohibited
in all CIHP-owned, leased, or controlled facilities and vehicles.  This includes all offices,
laboratories,  and  storage  rooms.    Employees  who  smoke  must  do  so  outside  of  CIHP
facilities.

Alcohol  and  other  banned  substances  may  not  be  consumed  during  work  hours.    No
employee may work under their influence on CIHP premises or while operating a CIHP
vehicle, no matter where the substances are consumed.  An employee found to be under
the  influence  of  alcohol  or  drugs  during  working  hours  is  subject  to  immediate
termination of employment.
The  use,  manufacture,  sale,  or  distribution  of  illegal  drugs  is  strictly  forbidden  and
grounds for immediate dismissal.

Section 2: Codes of Conduct

January 2012, Page 2-5

CIHP Standard Operating Procedures

Employees should not operate a CIHP vehicle while under the influence of any legal drug
that  may  cause  drowsiness  or  other  side  effects  that  may  be  dangerous  under  certain
circumstances.

2.5  DRESS CODE

CIHP  maintains  an  informal  but  professional  work  environment.    Employees  are
requested  to  give  careful  consideration  to  appropriate  business  appearance,  and  wear
appropriate attire, inclusive of proper clothing and footwear.

2.6  EQUAL OPPORTUNITY

CIHP  is  an  equal  opportunity  employer.   It  does  not  discriminate  against  employees  or
applicants  for  employment  on  the  basis  of  race,  color,  sex,  gender,  religion,  creed,
national  and  ethnic  origin,  age,  citizenship,  status  as  a  perceived  or  actual  victim  of
domestic  violence,  disability,  marital  status,  sexual  orientation,  or  any  other  legally
protected status.

CIHP  recognizes  that  certain  states  may  have  additional  anti-discrimination  laws  apart
from or beyond the above policy.  The guiding principle in all CIHP offices is that the
higher standard of anti-discrimination is the one that rules.

2.7  DISCRIMINATION AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT

CIHP  is  committed  to  providing  a  working  and  learning  environment  free  from
discrimination and sexual harassment and to fostering a nurturing and vibrant community
founded upon the fundamental dignity and worth of all of its members.  Consistent with
this commitment and with applicable federal, state, and local laws, it is CIHP’s policy not
to  tolerate  discrimination  and  sexual  harassment  in  any  form  and  to  provide  those  who
feel that they are victims of either with mechanisms for seeking redress as stated in the
Employee Policy Manual.

This  means  that  employees  have  the  right  to  the  enjoyment  of  a  workplace  that  is  free
from harassment by word of mouth or conduct resulting in fear, pressure, or discomfort
caused by any other fellow employee.  Employees who engage in any form of harassment
of other employees shall be in breach of this agreement and shall be liable to disciplinary
action or immediate dismissal.

All  CIHP  staff  are  subject  to  CIHP’s  Staff  HIV  Policy,  which  prohibits  discrimination
against those affected by HIV/AIDS.

2.8  WORKPLACE VIOLENCE

CIHP does not tolerate any acts or threats of violence committed by or against employees.
CIHP will discipline or terminate any employee found to have violated this policy.

premises will be subject to immediate disciplinary action up to and including termination.

2.9

PROPERTY USAGE AND RETURN

CIHP  equipment  shall  be  used  for  CIHP-specific  duties  only  and  not  to  be  used  for
personal  use  or  removed  from  the  office  without  the  authority  of  the  Director,
Management Support Services or the HR/Admin Manager.

2.9.1

COMMUNICATION USAGE

No  CIHP-provided  network  may  be  used  for  any  purpose  or  in  a  manner  that  violates
organizational statutes or regulations or Nigerian federal, state or local law.  Nor may it
be used for any purpose or in a manner that violates the law where CIHP is operating.

Communication services such as telephone, e-mail, and Internet are to be used solely for
CIHP  business  purposes.    Personal  phones  should  be  used  to  place  personal  calls  and
employees  should  limit  the  amount  of  business  time  used  for  personal  conversation.
Internet  usage  should  be  restricted  to  appropriate  sites  and  content  matter  pertaining  to
the  operation  and  function  of  CIHP  programs.    The  following  web  content  or  usage  is
considered unprofessional and not allowed, and an employee accessing it will be subject
to disciplinary measures:  sexually explicit material, downloaded music, games, and other
material deemed inappropriate by CIHP management.

2.9.2

EQUIPMENT RETURN

Employees shall return any materials, equipment, or funds belonging to CIHP before or
on  their  last  day  of  employment.    Departing  employees  will  be  held  responsible,  at  the
discretion  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  or Director  of Management Support Services,
for replacement and repair of any materials or equipment damaged through negligence.
